------------------------------

*** Highlights ***

- Changed some of the modern Spell Casting Proc items so they won't trigger from other proc effects or twincast. This is a step, but not the entire solution, to reduce raid lag. Recursive proc casting is causing a huge amount of spells to be cast in a short time.

- Druid and Ranger Epic: Venril Sathir's remains will spawn every 20 hours instead of just over 26 hours. This will increase the window to access this NPC for quest hand-ins.
- Magician Epic: Undertow (and its placeholder) will spawn every 6 hours instead of just over 7 hours.
- Monk Epic changes:
- - Increased the chance for Targin the Rock from 5% to 15% and Raster of Guk from 2% to 10%.

- - Lhranc will now spawn 13 hours after being killed and from 5 to 15 hours after a zone or server reset.
- - NPCs involved in the quest for Innoruuk's Curse can now see things that are invisible. They will only deal with people they like.
- Wizard Epic: Broken golem will now spawn 8 hours after being killed and from 4 to 12 hours after a zone or server reset.


*** Spells ***

- Beastlord - Auspice of Kildrukaun Rk. II and Rk. III can now be selected as rewards from the Lesser Bloodmarked Velium Gem and Lesser Dragontouched Rune, respectively.


*** NPCs ***

- All wares sold by Morton Stonebreaker in Western Wastes have had a pricing decrease.


*** Overseer ***

- Changed how Overseer quests load and save as a speculative fix to the bug where Overseer quests sometimes disappear. As part of this change, all Overseer Active Quests have been deleted. For the inconvenience, all players who have used Overseer before should have an Overseer Agent Pack available in /itemoverflow.


*** Miscellaneous ***

- Made the following changes to guild halls to prevent them from being removed when a player deletes their character or server transfers:
- - Placed guild halls no longer have an item owner, instead, they are owned by the guild.
- - Only the guild leader will be able to put a placed guild hall in their inventory.
- - Anyone with Move-Item access will be able to adjust a guild hall's placement.

- Marketplace - Corrected an issue where additional Mount Key Ring Slots were not visible for purchase.
- Fixed a bug that caused group invites to someone that has a shortened version of your name to not function.
