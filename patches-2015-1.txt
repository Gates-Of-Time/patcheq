*** Hotfix ***


- All Arx Mentis progression raids will now only pull people from the raid areas to their safe points rather than everyone in the zone.
- Praetor Captain Tita (Raid) - Fixed an error that was causing her to cast the wrong spells on the wrong targets and preventing the Slapstick achievement from being completed. She will now correctly use her ability Shield Sweep, which does damage in a forward arc and a little knockback.

- Principal Indagatrix Lucia (Raid) - Principal Indagatrix Lucia will no longer jump to attack NPCs, including pets or Firiona. Also, when she warns about incoming parasites, she will shout so that all of her Magia can hear her.

    *** Highlights ***

    - The Advanced Loot System is here! See the section below for details.
    - Added a prompt when deleting a character to make the player type the character's name as the confirmation instead of clicking a button.
    - Most vendors from the Plane of Knowledge have returned from hiatus. They feel as though they can still compete with all-in-one vendors.


    *** Advanced Loot System ***

    - Please note that there are extensive help files available in the /advloot window. The following is an overview to help you get started.
    - If you wish to disable the Advanced Loot System, type /advloot, click on the "Edit Filters" button, and then uncheck the "Use Advanced Looting" option there.

    - When you are solo, any loot from NPCs you kill will appear in your Personal Loot List. You have these options with things that appear on this list:
    - - Loot: Click the green check mark and this item will be placed in your inventory immediately.
    - - Leave: Click on the red X and the item will be left on the NPC's corpse.
    - - AN (Always Need): Check this box to say you always "need" this item. While solo you will always loot this item automatically (if you have Apply Filters checked).
    - - AG (Always Greed): Check this box to say you always "want" this item. While solo you will always loot this item automatically (if you have Apply Filters checked).
    - - Never: Click on this red X and the item will be added to your "never" filter, meaning it will never be added to your personal loot list again (if you have Apply Filters checked).
    - - Loot All: If you choose this button, the system will attempt to move everything in your Personal Loot List in to your inventory.

    - When you are in a group, the Master Looter's name will appear in the loot window, and the following options now appear in your Shared Loot List:
    - - ND (Need): Indicate that this item will benefit you directly.
    - - GD (Greed): Indicate that you would like this item.
    - - NO: Indicate that you do not want this item.
    - - AN (Always Need): If you select this, you will always roll "Need" for this item.
    - - AG (Always Greed): If you select this, you will always roll "Greed" for this item.
    - - NV (Never): Indicate that you never want this item.

    - If you are the Master Looter, you have the following additional options:
    - - Action: This is an icon that shows the current status of the item. It defaults to "Ask" (Question Mark) which will ask your group to speak up for the item. If you click this button, it will change to "Stop" (Red octagon), which will stop all action relating to the item.
    - - Manage: If you click the gear icon, you open the Manage window. From this window you can choose the following:
    - - - Leave On Corpse will leave the item on the corpse. Once the corpse unlocks, anyone is free to loot it.
    - - - You can also choose a player in your group from the drop-down menu and click "Give." This will award the item to that player directly.
    - - - If you check "Auto Roll," an automated random roll will occur whenever this item is seen again, awarding the item directly to the winner.
    - - Roll: Check this box to initiate a roll for the item.
    - - You can also right-click on the item for the following options:
    - - - Free Grab: The first person to express interest in this item (by checking ND, GD, AN, or AG) will get it.
    - - - Leave on Corpse: The item is removed from the Shared Loot List and anyone can loot it from the corpse.
    - - - Give to: This option lets you give the item directly to a specific person in your group.


    *** Quests & Events ***

    - Artifacts of Great Importance - Made eating mushrooms a bit easier in this Heroic Adventure, and fixed a bug that could prevent the task from progressing if you ate the mushrooms too quickly. You no longer need to target yourself when using the Living Fungi (but if you want to, go for it).
    - Liquid Courage - A Flask of Fire Water no longer incorrectly sends messages regarding a bonus objective. The real method to obtain the objective does not involve this item.
    - Korucust's Royal Pain - Corrected a problem that could allow players to complete some task elements out of order and get stuck.
    - Korucust's Royal Pain - Removed the requirement to have the key on your cursor when opening locked doors. It can merely be in your inventory.

    - In the Plane of Fear, a harbinger of Fear can help adventurers get their epic 1.0 pieces that would normally drop from Cazic-Thule or the golems. These pieces cannot be multi-quested or traded. In addition, a harbinger of Fear can advance the Whistling Fists quest in the same way as Cazic-Thule.


    *** Spells ***

    - Druids - All spells in the Winter's Flame line have been changed to work like Winter's Wildflame. The component spells will now receive the full benefit of damage foci but will not use twincast counters on their own. The base spells can still be twincast as before.
    - Magicians - Added "No Twincast" effects to all levels of Rampaging Servant. This allows the pet to be focused but prevents the single point of damage on this spell from using Twincast charges.
    - Rangers - All spells in the Summer's Dew line have been changed to work like Summer's Cyclone. The component spells will now receive the full benefit of damage foci but will not use twincast counters on their own. The base spells can still be twincast as before.

    *** NPC ***

    - Brasse's beard has been located and returned to the correct location.
    - Most vendors from the Plane of Knowledge have returned from hiatus. They feel as though they can still compete with all-in-one vendors.

    - Removed the force pop-up of the Welcome Screen when logging in.
    - Opening the petition window in your default browser should no longer point to an invalid page.
    - /hidecorpse options: always, looted, listed and listedunlocked will now persist when zoning and logging off.
    - Optimized the processing of long merchant lists. They should open more quickly now.


    *** UI ***

    - Added the new /autobank command. This will attempt to place any item on your cursor in your bank.
    - The voice chat window is no longer active by default.
    - /clearchat and /clearallchat now function while in hover mode.
    - Fixed an issue with the Find window where scrolling to the bottom wouldn't stay there if you were in a group with 'show group' enabled.
    - Added the ability for coin and point crystals to update when custom UIs move them to the alternate currencies tab.
    - Added a prompt when deleting a character to make the player type the character's name as the confirmation instead of clicking a button.

    - Many UI files have been changed. If you are unable to log in to a character with a custom UI, be sure to check the "Reset UI to Default" option just below "Enter World" on the Character Select screen.

*** Highlights ***

- Advanced Loot System: Improved the performance of adding, deleting, and changing loot filter settings (AN/AG/Never).
- Spells with resource tap components will now stack with each other as intended.
- When you invite a non-grouped character to the raid it should now put them in "not in a group" and not as a group leader.


*** Quests & Events ***

- Cleansing the Grounds - Heavily modified this Heroic Adventure to make it a bit easier and more rewarding.
- Principal Quastori Numicia - Fixed an error that prevented players from obtaining the Balance of Power achievement in this raid.
- In Kedge Keep, a harbinger of the seas can help adventurers get their epic 1.0 pieces that would normally drop from Phinigel Autropos.
- In Dreadlands, a harbinger of frost can help adventurers get their epic 1.0 pieces that would normally drop from Gorenaire.
- In Skyfire Mountains, a harbinger of flame can help adventurers get their epic 1.0 pieces that would normally drop from Talendor.
- All item drops from these harbingers (including those added in earlier updates) must now be converted via a right-click before they can be handed to the quest NPC.
- These harbingers will not appear on Progression servers until House of Thule is unlocked.


*** Spells ***

- Spells that are triggered by doom effects will now check for stacking conflicts before they are applied.
- Spells with resource tap components will now stack with each other as intended.


*** NPC ***

- Warrior guards in Neriak Commons and Third Gate are no longer flagged as Noble exchange merchants. Guard W`Selo by the bank will still be happy to take your business.


*** Mercenaries ***

- Fixed a problem that caused the game to repeatedly send messages in load balanced zones about suspending mercenaries even when there were no mercenaries to suspend.


*** Miscellaneous ***

- Advanced Loot System: Improved the performance of adding, deleting, and changing loot filter settings (AN/AG/Never).
- Fixed a bug that wasn't allowing /autobank to put empty containers in containers in your bank.
- Fixed a misleading message given to players when they attempted to create fellowship camps when three players weren't close enough to the camp.
- When you invite a non-grouped character to the raid it should now put them in "not in a group" and not as a group leader.
- Removed an errant text message when you enter an expedition (not an adventure) that launches with an LDoN switch.
- Created new option for players to switch instances in load-balanced zones with the new /pickzone command. Once a flagged zone reaches a threshold of players, it will start another instance of of the zone which you will be able to go to. The goal of this functionality is to help reduce congestion in starting areas.
- Corrected the order in which the current Progression Server poll questions appear.


*** UI ***

- If load balancing has created a new instance of a zone, you will see the ID of the instance you zone in to. It will also now appear at the top of the /pickzone window.
- Convertible items now have an item link in the description window to show you what the item will be transformed into.
- Fixed some confirmation popup windows that were asking for incorrect or irrelevant information. Deleting spell sets was one such example.
- Made the Audio Triggers list window resizable.

- Changed -

EQUI_MIZoneSelectWnd.xml

- Korucust's Royal Pain - Lowered the difficulty of NPCs in this mission.
- Liquid Courage - Fixed an issue that was causing the bonus objective to be awarded to the incorrect person (or nobody).

    *** Highlights ***

    - Added a search function for advanced loot filters.
    - Improved the load speed of characters into the world and when reloading UI.
    - Moved the advanced loot settings from the Edit Filters window into a new window.
    - Corrected a problem that caused some events that take place in instanced zones, such as the Arcane Fair for the Wizard step of "An Epic Request", to stop working.


    *** Quests & Events ***

    - Calix Quirinus (Raid) - Corrected a bug that caused messaging about Lanys' Area of Effect attack to fail. Cut the radius of her targeted Area of Effect knockback in half.
    - Calix Quirinus (Raid) - Corrected a bug that caused Arc Worker adds to change targets every 5 seconds instead of every 20 seconds as intended.


    *** Spells ***

    - Corrected a bug that caused adjustments to critical chance to also affect critical amount.
    - Spells with 'doom' effects, such as Promised heals and Kron's Maelstrom, should now stack more intelligently.


    *** NPC ***

    - All translocators can now see you if you are hiding or invisible.


    *** AA ***

    - AA abilities that place a 'doomed' effect on their target will now stack properly.
    - Fixed a bug that allowed Enchanters to gain full control over summoned animations without purchasing the Animation Empathy AAs.
    - Adjusted the way that the Eyes Wide Open line of AA abilities are granted to be more consistent between ranks. You will no longer be required to purchase any rank at a 0 cost. Additionally, all shrouds and template characters will have Eyes Wide Open granted to them innately so that all slots in the extended target window behave as expected, even in template form.
    - Enchanter - Made the following adjustments to Gift of Hazy Thoughts:
    -- 1. Increased the proc chance from 5 to 8 percent.
    -- 2. The version of Chromatic Haze that is cast by Gift of Hazy Thoughts is now equivalent to rank 6 of the Chromatic Haze instead of rank 1.
    -- 3. The spell can now only be triggered when casting 0-duration direct damage spells with a non-zero cast time, minimum level of 85, and a mana cost.
    - Enchanter - Adjusted Sanguine Mind Crystal and Azure Mind Crystal in the following ways:
    -- 1. Summoning a Mind Crystal now has a 1 second cast time.
    -- 2. Summoning a Sanguine Mind Crystal now has a 5 minute recast timer.
    -- 3. Summoning an Azure Mind Crystal now has a 5 minute recast timer.
    -- 4. The Sanguine Mind Crystals summoned by the AA now share a lore group and 5 minute recast time.
    -- 5. The Azure Mind Crystals summoned by the AA now share a lore group and a 5 minute recast timer.
    -- 6. The mana cost for summoning a mind crystal is now twice the amount of hit points or mana returned by that crystal. In the case of rank 1 this is a mana cost reduction; for ranks 2-4 this is a mana cost increase.
    -- 7. Corrected a typo in the description for the amount of mana returned by Azure Mind Crystals.
    - Monk - Restored the knockback on the spell Dragon Force. The monk skill Dragon's Balance will now prevent Dragon Force from being cast while Dragon's Balance Effect is active.
    - Shaman - Corrected Extended Languid Bite so that it now functions as described.
    - Wizard - The critical chance reduction on Arcane Fusion no longer reduces the critical damage as well.

    *** Miscellaneous ***

    - If you die in a load balanced instance of a zone that you are bound in, you will now respawn in your former instance instead of respawning in the base instance.
    - Grouped players who are feared when an NPC that drops loot dies will now correctly see the items without having to re-login or re-zone.
    - Fixed a bug with advanced looting occasionally not updating the window properly for non-master looters when an item is given to a player with many items in their shared list.
    - Removed the 0.2 second weapon delay associated with using the /autofire command.
    - Fixed an error that caused multiple polls to be listed in the incorrect order.

    - Fixed a client crash involving reloading the UI and changing race.
    - Replaced a few logos and text references to reflect our new company name.

    EQUI_Animations.xml
    EQUI_CharacterListWnd.xml
    EQUI_EQMainWnd.xml
    EQUI_LootFiltersWnd.xml
    EQUI_LootSettingsWnd.xml
    EQUI_MarketplaceWnd.xml


    *** Previously Updated ***

    *** Highlights ***

    - Many more zones will spin up new instanced versions when they are populated by enough adventurers.


    *** Spells ***

    - Druids - All spells in the Winter's Flame line have been changed to work like Winter's Wildflame. The component spells will now receive the full benefit of damage foci but will not use twincast counters on their own. The base spells can still be twincast as before.
    - Rangers - All spells in the Summer's Dew line have been changed to work like Summer's Cyclone. The component spells will now receive the full benefit of damage foci but will not use twincast counters on their own. The base spells can still be twincast as before.


    *** NPC ***

    - Soulbinders have discovered how to reliably bind the soul of all adventurers, even in non-city zones.


    *** AA ***

    *** Progression Servers ***

    - Forged Firebrand weapon creation will be disabled on Progression Servers until Brunnel Kegstander appears to teach their recipes to the world.
    - Kaxon Frennor should now appear on all Progression Servers, but will not offer his newbie weapon quest until the appropriate time.

    *** Quests & Events ***

    Fixed the Deepwater Harpoon quest. The missing sentries have returned to West Freeport, and Sentry Xyrin will again attack the nearby spectres on the island when inspired to do so.

    *** Miscellaneous ***

    - Fixed an issue where items intended for Ragefire were appearing on other servers.
    - Corrected the navigation of boats through the Ocean of Tears. They should spend much more of their time in the water now.


    *** UI ***

    - Changed /pickzone so that it will show all of the available instances instead of just the first 10.
    - Changed the messaging if you are in a login queue to signify you were already in the queue.

Game Update Notes: June 17, 2015
------------------------------

    *** Highlights ***

    - Fixed an issue where a player could crash after logging back into a load-balanced zone (/pickzone) or gating to a point in a load-balanced zone when that particular instance had closed.
    - Corrected an issue causing players entering mission instances of some zones to be teleported to the non-instanced versions.
    - Fixed an issue regarding binding in a load-balanced zone; you should now properly be sent to an available zone when gating or returning to your bind point.
    - Fixed an issue with the leave on corpse option in the manage loot window that could cause crashes.
    - All Noble Exchange merchants can now be used to send or receive parcels. These merchants are available in every starting city, the Plane of Knowledge, the Bazaar, and other zones throughout Norrath.


    *** Items ***

    - Bard - Reduced the casting time of the Arpeggio spells on certain breastplates from 0.3s to instant.


    *** Quests & Events ***

    - Arx Mentis raids - Glowing Essences of the Citadel now have a small chance to drop in Tier 2 Arx Mentis raids and drop more commonly from Calix Quirinus.
    - All Arx Mentis progression raids - Now drop exactly six Essences of the Citadel rather than between four and eight.
    - Anniversary - The 5th-13th Anniversary events have been extended to run until July 15th.
    - Heritage - The Crushbone and Permafrost Hardcore Heritage events have been extended by a week and will now end on 7/1.


    *** Spells ***

    - Buffs with limited charges that are consumed when their focus effect is applied now continue to apply their remaining effects until the spell that was focused by that buff is finished resolving. This corrects a problem where the critical chance portion of spells (like Chromatic Haze and Frenzied Devastation) was never applied during the buff's final charge, because the buff was removed after the focus effect was applied but before the critical chance modifier was checked.


    *** NPC ***

    - All Noble Exchange merchants can now be used to send or receive parcels. These merchants are available in every starting city, the Plane of Knowledge, the Bazaar, and other zones throughout Norrath.
    - Added factions to many NPCs in newbie zones that did not have them before, causing guards to hate them once again.


    *** AA ***

    - Bard - Restored the doppelganger effect and removed the shadowstep component on the AA line "Lyrical Prankster".
    - Beastlord - Corrected a bug with ranks 4-6 of the AA line "Nature's Salve" that caused them to cast the spell associated to rank 3 of the ability. Ranks 4-6 should now increase in power and trigger the effect on your warder as originally intended.
    - Rogue - Corrected an issue that caused rank 6 of AA Extended Envenomed Blades to not function.
    - Rogue - Corrected an issue that prevented all ranks of the AA Enduring Vision from working.
    - Wizard - Arcane Fusion no longer deals damage to non-NPC targets. This should ensure that wizards who fail their Bucolic Gambit are slightly less likely to annihilate themselves.
    - Corrected a typo in the description of the buff cast by the AA "Glyph of the Cataclysm".
    - Corrected several inconsistencies with the casting level of AA abilities.


    *** Progression Servers ***

    - Restored the spell merchant Gadallion to the Southern Desert of Ro in all eras.
    - The Wizard spell Rend is now available on Progression Servers in all eras.
    - The Potion of Companion's Amnesia is now available for purchase in the marketplace on all Progression Servers.
    - "an old froglok" in Upper Guk no longer spawns on Progression Servers until the Planes of Power expansion is unlocked.
    - Luminescent Weapon Grade Ore is no longer be available for purchase on Progression Servers until Rain of Fear has unlocked.
    - Some cookie molds that were not available at launch are no longer available on Progression Servers.
    - Recipes that call for Thalium Ore are no longer visible on Progression Servers until Dragons of Norrath.


    *** Miscellaneous ***

    - Steamfont Mountains will now correctly use load balancing as intended.
    - Corrected an oversight that prevented players that were created on the Vox server from being able to select the suffix "of Vox".


    *** UI ***

    - There is now a chat message of how much time you have before you can run /pickzone again, if you have a timer remaining.
    - You now get a message in chat with what instance you are in when you run /pickzone in a load-balanced zone. This will only appear when it is possible for the window to open, meaning any circumstance where /pickzone won't function (such as combat) will prevent this message from appearing.


    - Changed -

    *** Previously Updated ***

    - Fixed the Deepwater Harpoon quest. Returned the missing sentries to West Freeport, and Sentry Xyrin will again attack the nearby spectres on the island when inspired to do so.
