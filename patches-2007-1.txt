------------------------------

*** Items ***

- Corrected an issue that would cause some items that were casting player-usable spells to 
block the player from casting the same spell from their spell book until the item recast time 
was complete. 
- Removed weight from all augments.
- Dyn`leth's Spy Glass will power up faster than before.
- Blessed Dust of Tunare and Blue Diamond Powder now stack up to 100.
- Scarlet Legion Command Stone will now give the correct stats.
- Pouch of Goldfire Ore Dust is now tradable on Firiona Vie. 
- Akihiro in Stillmoon now drops items when killed.
- Keikolin`s Mindhaze Sleeves now have a chromatic damage focus effect instead of a magic 
damage focus effect.
- Goru's Girdle of the Deceased now has Improved Parry IV instead of Improved Parry III.
- Increased the damage on Fleshmelter, Lethar's Maul.
- Ice-Striated Iron Orb should now function properly.
- Corrected an issue that would cause backstab damage to be calculated incorrectly if the weapons 
base damage was too high.
- The statistics on the items created by Summon Aenda's Trinkets have been improved.

*** Tribute ***

- Higher ranks of tribute and guild tribute are now available. 

*** Tradeskills ***

- Changed lightningbane's recipe to use the correct thickener.
- Many of the tradeskill items introduced in The Serpent Spine expansion should now show up as 
"combinable" in the bazaar. 

*** Quests 

- Several of the quests in Ashengate will no longer be blocked by rare spawns.
- Large events in Frostcrypt and Ashengate now yield more tier III spell runes.
- Lorekeeper Fenegar will no longer be giving people diseased fish as a bonus reward for finding 
lost ancient documents for him. He realized that adventurers don't really like diseased fish as 
much as he thought they would. This was an extra reward given out in error. The real reward will 
still be given out.

*** NPCs ***

- An additional artifact has been found in Direwind that Librarian Hemfar may be interested in.
- A vendor named The Quiet Wanderer has moved into Sunderock Springs. He offers spells and abilities 
of the calming persuasion, including several which were not previously available: Song: Whispersong 
of Veshma, Spell: Drifting Fog, Spell: Dulcify, Spell: Nature's Placidity, Spell: Quiet Mind, and 
Tome of Phantom Silhouette.

*** Spells ***

- Based on feedback from the Druid community, Wildskin and Blessing of the Wild have been replaced 
on a one-for-one basis with Blistering Sunray and Sunscorch. The old spells will be replaced with the 
new ones.
- Based on feedback from the Cleric community, Rectitude and Cure Corruption have been replaced with 
Blessing of Purpose and Ward of the Dauntless. Rectitude was swapped on a one-for-one basis with 
Blessing of Purpose. However, because Cure Corruption is used by multiple classes the spell could not 
be swapped directly with Ward of the Dauntless, so clerics can simply no longer use the Cure Corruption
spell. Turning in a Rank III spell rune while you have Cure Corruption scribed will result in a copy of 
Ward of the Dauntless Rank III and a return of the spell rune. Aside from that, Cure Corruption can be 
deleted from the spell book.
- The number of "procs" that Steeltrap Jaws can fire before fading have been doubled.
- Skin to Vines will now work on a wider variety of NPC targets.

*** Miscellaneous ***

- The ability to dye armor has been added to the Drakkin race.

players.

*** Highlights ***

Welcome to EverQuest: The Buried Sea, the 13th expansion for EverQuest!

Throngs of undead trample the earth both night and day as Norrath's sun withers. With each passing 
hour, the growing numbers of creatures of the night rising from crypt and grave seem part of a grand 
design to overwhelm the lands.

Trouble also lurks deep beneath the Buried Sea off the coast of Odus in a city named Katta Castrum 
which has remained undiscovered for millennia. It is a city built to sustain the beloved leader of 
the Combine Empire named Tsaph Katta who was poisoned by General Seru. Generations of Combine 
Loyalists have tried to cure and awaken Katta while they house threatened populations of Kedge, 
Shissar, and Sphinx. But in recent times, the artifact that powers and protects their city has 
weakened. Without it, the city will be crushed under the pressure of the sea.

Only the most intrepid Norrathians have the power to save them.


- Ship-to-Ship Combat: Cross the plank and fight for your life on the open seas as you raid pirate 
vessels!

- Two Paths of Advancement: Battle pirates on the open seas or dive deep beneath the sea to Katta 
Castrum, lost stronghold of the Combine Empire.

- New Missions: Take your group through more than 60 challenging new missions ranging from defending 
merchant vessels against marauding pirates to uncovering the secrets behind the combine city and the 
danger that threatens it!

- Guild Banners: Guilds can create a unique Guild Banner from a large selection of symbols and colors. 
The banner becomes the mark of the guild and when enough guild members are in the same zone (two groups), 
the guild leaders or officers can plant the banner in the ground. While a guild banner is planted, 
members can use the Guild Hall portal to teleport directly to the banner. This allows players to 
easily catch up with guild mates. The guild banner can also be upgraded to provide different effects, 
like regeneration. Upgraded Guild Banners are expendable, but provide an effect to everyone in the 
guild who is in range of the banner while it is planted. Guilds can only have one standard up at a time. 
You can access Guild Banner information through a tab in the Guild Window and banners will be sold in the 
Plane of Knowledge.

- Fellowships: A Fellowship is like a mini-guild for those who play together regularly. Fellowships have 
a maximum of six players and exist in addition to guilds. All members of the Fellowship get a token, 
access to a Fellowship-only channel, and the ability to create campfires when at least three "fellows" 
are in the same area. Fellows use their tokens to transport directly to the campfire allowing them to
catch up with their regular playmates quickly. Campfires can be upgraded to provide effects to nearby 
Fellows. These upgrades are expendable and need to be repurchased. A Fellowship can only have one 
campfire active at a time. Randall of the Fellows in the Plane of Knowledge will register Fellowships. 
Fellowship items are also available for sale in the Plane of Knowledge.

- Energeian Power Source Items: Tapping into the Combine Empire's technology, players gain access to a 
new inventory slot for an Energeian power source. Particular pieces of Energeiac armor will tap into 
Energeian power sources, gaining benefits from the type that is equipped. For example, an Energeiac 
sword gains a chance to cast a fire damage spell if a fire Energeian source is equipped or a frost spell 
if a cold one is. Energeian power sources are expendable and will deplete as they are used, but can be
changed on the fly to let players customize effects simply by changing the Energeian source. Energeian 
items will be for sale from vendors, found on monsters, and some can be tradeskilled.

- Toxxulia Forest: An updated Toxxulia Forest is now available that includes Kerra Ridge and access to 
The Buried Sea expansion zones.


********************
*** Live Updates ***
********************

*** In Game Mail Sytem ***

In order to improve the performance of the in game mail system, starting on February 20, 2007, we will 
be implementing a routine purge that will clear out all in game mail that is more than 4 months old. 
This will be an ongoing process. 

You can now use the Export feature. This new feature will grant players the ability to export their in-game 
mail to a text file in the EverQuest directory. To use the new Export feature, take the following steps: 

- Open up the e-mail window (ctrl-E). 
- Select the messages you would like to export by clicking them in the top pane, using shift-click and/or 
ctrl-click if you would like to select multiple messages. 
- Click "Export". 
- The selected messages are then saved to a file in the EverQuest Mail directory with a name in the format:
SavedMessages_charactername_servername.txt. 
- This export will need to be done with each character that has mail you wish to save. 


*** Items ***

- Mana Flare strikes now generate little to no additional agro.
- Performer's Psalm of Pyrotechnics and Weshlu's Chillsong Aria will no longer work on damage over time 
spells.

across the board.
- Several level-capped spells from Serpent's Spine have had their maximum level increased to 78: Echo of 
Misdirection, Spinning into the Void, Color Collapse, Dreams of Veldyn, and Wake of Subdual.
- Debuffs that increase the damage the target takes from certain elements, (Icefall Breath, Skin to Vines, 
Scent of Twilight, and Malosinise) now work on Damage over Time spells as well as Direct Damage spells.

amount of hit points.

target if it successfully lands.


*** NPC ***

- The skeletons in Dreadspire can no longer see through invisibility to undead.


*** Miscellaneous ***

- Tacvi, Inktu'Ta, Ikkinz, and Uqua now have the same entry requirements as their parent zones (Txevu,

- The Ctrl-R-Click option has moved from the tradeskill window to the options window.
- Players can now use /chat while they are hovering over their body.

to items, prices, stack sizes update appropriate for other players.

*** Previously Updated ***

- Increased the number of spell runes that drop from the Large Events (Augment Events) in Frostcrypt and 
Ashengate from 2 to 3

Happy 8th Anniversary EverQuest!

On March 16, 2007, EverQuest will celebrate its 8th Anniversary.

To commemorate this landmark occasion, we have introduced dozens of Fabled Luclin NPCs and have brought back all the fabled fiends of years past. There is also a new scavenger hunt! Speak with Tyla Filinav in the Nexus if you are interested in helping her collect a few things.

- The clockworks in the Nurtha raid now hit for slightly less damage.


*** Spells ***

- Reduced the reuse time on Intensity of the Resolute to 6 hours and the duration of the effect to 1 minute. 


*** Miscellaneous ***

- Looting Twisted Harp Strings will now fully backflag you for Deathknell.  You will no longer need to get the additional Inspiration.

In some cases we have tested the optimization and have seen a 15 percent gain in frame rate.

You can toggle apv optimizations off and on with the slash command, "/apvoptimizations." When EverQuest is loaded it checks for an "APVOptimizations" key value pair specified in the eqclient.ini and turns portalizing off or on depending on this value. If a value does not exist in this file it gets set to on by default and written to the eqclient.ini file. Once changes are made to the state of the apv optimizations, the eqclient.ini file will be updated accordingly. 
- A certain time between two /say commands is not required anymore. Good people don'?t spam.


*** Future Tradeskill Changes ***

We will be making a change to the cultural armor that will nullify the usage of all existing drops in the cultural armor and symbol crafting process. For the slot 12 raid augments, only the drops for the seals will be changing, the rest of the drops required for the various steps of the slot 12 raid augments will be staying the same. Those of you who have stockpiles will want to make use of them as best and quickly as possible, as once the changes go in, the currently existing cultural recipes will no longer work. This change will even out the disparity of drop rates between different races and remove the extreme rarity of some items.

For more detailed information please see the "Upcoming Cultural Changes" sticky thread in the Artisans Way forum of the official EverQuest forums.

*** Highlights ***

- Jardel's Hook Mission: Long ago, a holy war brewed between the Redfeather aviaks and the Suncrest goblins. Using a blessed artifact of the ocean god, Prexus, the Suncrest goblins shaped the tide in the Buried Sea. The aviaks, fearful of the power the goblins possessed countered with their own artifact blessed by Karana, the god of storms, which created monsoons and heavy rain. This era in the Buried Sea became known as the Time of Storms. Many years after it began, the war ended abruptly when a powerful siren stole both artifacts and hid them somewhere in the vast expanse of the Buried Sea. Find out what happened to these powerful artifacts in a new mission in the Buried Sea! 

- Ocean of Tears: The Ocean of Tears has a new look. Sail over to check it out and to experience the return of the boats!

- A new integrated web browser has been added to EverQuest. This web browser will be accessible from either the help menu or the /petition command. From this point forward, all problems related to switching to an external browser will be eliminated because this browser will pull up in an in-game window.

- Congratulations to the winners of EverQuest's "The Fabled Adventurer" Video Contest. The First Place winner was Quarken of the Maelin Starpyre server. You can view the winning video on EQPlayers.station.sony.com.


*** Recently Reported Issues ***

First of all, we want to thank everyone for their assistance with reporting bugs in the game. Your effort helps us pinpoint the source of bugs so that they can be resolved as quickly as possible. Our main source of reports on bugs comes from the in-game submitted /bug reports but we also get verification from /petitions and forum posts. 

In order to make sure everyone knows what we are currently aware of and working on, we will be frequently posting a List of Recently Reported Issues that have been addressed. The following is a list of the Recently Reported issues that have been resolved in this update:

Issue: Tartons Wheel (A Rod)
Summary: Players are unable to combine Staff of the Wheel in A Glowing Chest. The recipe that players must combine in order to get the Staff of the Wheel and Star of Eyes, eventually leading to the Ice Comet spell, is currently not useable. 
Status: The combine works properly again.

Issue: Elder Longshadow #4 Trailing Longshadow.
Summary: Players can port into the instance before completing the first element of the quest. The player is ported into the instance with no way to update element 0 of the task.
Status: You can no longer enter the instance before you have updated the first element of the quest.

Issue: Shaman spell 'Protection of Wishka' when scribed becomes 'Wishka's Favor'.
Summary: Name and description of item do not match the spell that is scribed from.
Status: The spell scrolls have been changed to the proper spell name.

Issue: NPC 'a goblin headmaster' in the 'Ocean of Tears' zone is not spawning.
Summary: The Goblin Headmaster is no longer spawning in the Oot zone.
Status: The Goblin Headmaster is spawning again in the new version of Ocean of Tears. 

Issue: EQPlayers site not updating character profiles.
Summary: People are reporting that their character profiles are still not updating.
Status: With this update, work will be done on the EQPlayers database. The hardware will be upgraded. We believe that this will help prevent the database from becoming overloaded which is what was causing many people not to get updated. There are some other changes that they will be making as well in regards to the flow of information. Once the upgrade is done and the changes are made we will be able to track the situation closer to determine exactly what is causing the problem if it occurs again.

Issue: Vah Shir Illusion makes Rogues naked.
Summary: Armor doesn't show up correctly when under illusion.
Status: The illusion should no longer hide the armor.
