January 16, 2008
------------------------------

Today's patch message:

Loot All has been changed to help resolve some client disconnect/corpse loss issues. This will cause the loot all to be slower than it was previously. When stability is improved, we will take a look at speeding it back up again. 

*** Highlights ***
- The beta reward item for players who participated in the Secrets of Faydwer beta test is now available.  Anyone who turned in at least 50 beta tokens (or a single raid token) can speak to Old Man Thorren in Plane of Knowledge on the beta server and request your reward.  This will then allow you to use the /claim system to claim the reward item, the Golden Mask of the Goblin King, on the character and server of your choice.

*** Items ***

- Made some slight changes to the rare group items in SoF.
- Changed the recast group on items with Geomantra to avoid interference with items that have no recast timer.
- Added a required level to the Bulwark of Many Portals.
- Added Augment Sockets to Elegant Crystalskin Sleeves.
- Changed the name of the Moray Eel from the Buried Sea to Barren Moray Eel.
- Cultural augments (seals and symbols) will now only fit in armor.
- Elegant Charms have had an additional upgrade in their stats.
- Many potions that had a different required level than the required level for the spell have been changed to have the item required level match the spell required level. This will not change the functioning of the potion in any way, it will just reduce confusion as to the intended level for the potion.
- Spider Food Poison and Worg Food Poison are no longer temporary.
- Raid loot drop tables have been increased.

*** Quests & Events ***

- The final two steps of the "Repairing the Spiritlight Earring" quest have been changed so that they can be completed in any zone.
- If your Spiritvoid Earring should have become a Damaged Spiritlight Earring but has not, hand it to Acolyte Emyria in Bloodmoon Keep and she will replace it.
- Selay will no longer be fooled into leaving Lethar.
- The Griffon Master event in Ashengate has been made a bit less difficult.
- Fixed a bug with the Dyn'leth raid that allowed players to avoid one of the mechanics.  Also gave the poor fellow a few more hit points.
- It is no longer possible to levitate near Veldyn.
- Fixed an issue that was causing the Operations Manager to spawn multiple times.
- Reduced the lockout timers on all Mansion and Crystallos raids to four and a half days.  This will not affect existing timers, only newly acquired timers.

- Improved the stacking on Hungry Flames.

- The word "Dispell" in spell memorization menus has been changed to "Dispel".
- Mana Recursion buffs will work on damage over time spells.
- Skeleton and specter form effects on the Necromancer's Lich line have been split off to a separate buff.  The caster can drop the illusion and still benefit from the mana regeneration effect.
- The attack benefit bestowed by Strength of the Hunter and Strength of the Forest Stalker has been reduced to appropriate values after the ranger innate attack boost was moved to AAs instead.
- Regeneration spells should no longer display a healed per tick message.

- Added Required levels to the Enchant Palladium and Enchant Dwerium scrolls.  This does not alter how they work, it just clarifies the abilities.

Tailoring will replace Etched Scale Stock Whip with Rough Leather Gorget Template, Concussive Bola with Pristine Leather Tunic Template, and Robe of Haunted Dreams with Fine Silk Robe Template. Tinkering will also replace the Steam-Powered Piston with a Collapsed Gnomish Recharge Kit.

*** AA ***

- Added additional ranks to Elemental Fury (Magician) and Quickening of Death (Necromancer) AA lines.

*** Zones ***

- Elevator music now plays in the Mansion elevators. The sound soothes the inhabitants and they should be less likely to attack folks that are just riding up or down.

*** Previously Updated ***

- Fixed a bug that could cause the Last Stand Into Eternity task to fail to trigger properly.

Hot Fix Notes - March 26, 2008
------------------------------

From the patcher:

*** Hotfix ***

Based on player feedback, we made a few improvements to the following existing raid encounters:

Lethar and Selay Raid: We made tuning changes to the Lethar and Selay raid in TSS including:

Increased the tether range on Selay slightly
Modified the rate at which Selay fires off her AEs to avoid her casting an AE at the same time Lethar does for the most part (although it may still happen once in a while!)
Selay will now follow Lethar when he moves from location to location to avoid having her tether just because he moved
Crystallos Raids: We made some tuning adjustments to Crystallos Raids including:

Fixed a reset issue with the Halls of Fire raid in the Fire Wing
Fixed a reset issue with the Keeper of Stones event. Also changed the Adds in the event to spawn in a more physically spaced out manner so they dont all come at the raid at the exact same time.
We made a tuning change to the Kildrukaun the Prophet raid. We added a new mechanic to the event. Enjoy!
Made various tuning changes to the Vyskudra event. The stormrider drakes have had their offense values lowered and will react differently to mezmerization spells than they previously did.
Made various tuning changes to the Ice Constructs event in the Ice wing. The Ice Constructs should be easier to kill but now have additional mechanics.

April 1, 2008
------------------------------

From the patcher:

** Highlights ***

EverQuest is pleased to announce the introduction of a new service that will allow you to permanently change the gender or race of your characters.  This is something that has been requested by players since the inception of the game, but has only recently become possible due to changes that have been made in how characters are stored.



In order to make the use of this feature as simple as possible and to allow you to request this service without leaving the game, we have added NPCs to every static (non-instanced) zone in the game that listen for the key phrase I want to be a .  All you have to do is shout your request to the zone and when the NPC hears the key phrase, they will add your request to the processing queue.  The NPCs do not currently have a way to respond to requests via the shout command, so you wont get a response to your request.   This is something we plan to add to the system later, but we didnt want to hold up the release of this service.

For example, if you have a female character and want to request a change to a male character, you would issue the following command:

/shout I want to be a man  (note: I want to be a boy and I want to be a male will also work)

The service can take compound requests which include a change to both your race and gender.  If you wanted to change your character into a female iksar, for instance, you would issue the following command:

/shout I want to be a female iksar

Because we are anticipating a large amount of interest in this feature and wish to prevent possible performance problems that might occur, the servers are being limited to processing only a certain number of requests at a time and each character will only be allowed to change one time.  Once your character has been changed, subsequent requests will be ignored.  During heavy request times, it may take up to 24 hours before your request is processed.  If your request hasnt been processed within 24 hours, please reissue the command, ensure you are in a static, non-instanced, zone, and make sure that you have spelled the name of the race/gender properly when you do so.

Important Note:  Once the service has been requested, it cannot be altered and the change to your character is permanent.  GMs are not able to assist with reversals, so please be absolutely sure about your decision before requesting the change.  Changes to your race may alter your faction standings, so please be careful when exploring the world right after a race change.

Enjoy,


- The EverQuest Team

Here are the patch notes from today's patch (this is the 'sneak peek' version, subject to change). 

*** Highlights ***

- The 10th Veteran Reward, Summon Resupply Agent, is now available! 

- Alternate Advancement experience has been accelerated significantly for those with fewer AAs spent and will scale back down to the normal rate as more AAs are earned.

- Many keyed zones from the Ruins of Kunark, Scars of Velious, Shadows of Luclin, Planes of Power, Gates of Discord, Omens of War, Depths of Darkhollow, and Prophecy of Ro have had their key/flag requirements modified.  All players that have obtained the key/flag will still be allowed entry into the zones, as will players that have met minimum level requirements for the zones.  The zones and minimum level requirements are as follows:

- Required Level 46 -
The Howling Stones
Old Sebilis
Skyshrine to Cobalt Scar

- Required Level 55 -
Sleeper's Tomb
Veeshan's Peak
Vex Thal
Locked areas of the Temple of Ssraeshza

- Required level 57 -
Bastion of Thunder
Halls of Honor
The Temple of Marr
Tower of Solusek Ro
Drunder, The Fortress of Zek

- Required Level 60 -

*** Items ***

- Added new spell drops to Meldrath's Majestic Mansion.
- Increased the drop rate slightly for some spells in Crystallos.
- Added recommended and required levels to some trade skill drops to help clarify their use. This does not change their actual use as trade skill containers do not pay attention to the recommended and required levels of items put in them.
- Added a set of new vendors that sell many of the spell research components. The cost of these have been adjusted so that they sell to an NPC closer to the price it cost to make them, but merchants will sell them at a premium.  This means that you can save money while gaining skill. Also when you make spell combines you can choose between saving money, or saving time. You save money by making the sub-combines yourself, you save time by buying them.
- Chromatic focus is now available for slot 12 augments for Cultural armor.
- The engineer steamworks that work within the guardian have developed devices that help them move within the beast.  Fortunately for adventurers they can be a bit absent minded about them and adventurers can find them lying about.
- A vial of raging heartblood is not as vile as it was previously.


*** Quests & Events ***

- Rylin Coil will now show and give all three tinkering mastery books for the tinkering mastery quest.

- The Adrenal Boost focus effect has been changed to Life Line, which is a mana cost reduction on Pure Life.
- The Closefisted Claw focus effect has been changed to Ethereal Breath, which is a damage increase on Ethereal Conflagration.
- Breastplate worn effects that enhanced one rank of a spell or discipline now enhance all three ranks.
- Reuse time reduction bonus on Assassin's Efficacy, Impenetrable Body, and Fit of Berserking Rage have been set to 25%.
- The Rage of Tri'Qaras effect triggered from Bulwark of Tri'Qaras is now a damage bonus that stacks with other effects.
- The recourse from the Challenge for Honor line will now appear in the bard buff box.
- The Vinelash Ensnare effect triggered from Vinelash Cascade will no longer overwrite the highest version of Entrap.
- The efficiency of Secrets of Faydwer direct damage spells now scales up on higher ranks of the same spell.
- Improved Block and Improved Parry have been merged.  Any item that previously had Improved Block or Improved Parry will now have Improved Parry / Block.


*** NPC ***

- Halima in Crescent Reach can now be found in the find window.
- Henrik O'Danos no longer sells Hypericum twice.
- Ralfin in Bloodmoon keep will now cast his heal spell less frequently.

- Increased the range of the Wrath of the Wild AA line to match other Damage Shield spells that Druids have.
- Increased the hitpoints and resists of all "Wards" for all classes to make them better able to resist ambient damage.

- Changed -

SIDL.xml

*** Miscellaneous ***

- Situation where double length timer was given on events has been fixed. This occurred specifically to people who dropped out of the expedition and hadn't been kicked out of the zone yet.
- Changes have been made to the way the client is notified about other entities (players, NPCs, etc.) in the zone.
- Changed NPC summon behavior to summon the player right in front of their current heading at 1/2 their melee range.  Calculations used to determine when the NPC should summon have been made a bit more accurate.
- Iksar and Wood Elves should be able to increase their forage skill caps after purchasing the forage AA.
- Corrected a problem with hate generation from skill attack abilities such as Hail of Arrows and Decimator's Volley.  They were generating considerably more hate than they should and have been returned to their previous, lower hate generation.
- Zone-wide /who commands now use a similar code path to server wide /who all commands.  Note that this will impose a similar time limit to how often it can be used.
- The bobbing effect of levitation has been removed.  A new effect that pushes you off the ground about a foot and a half has been introduced.
- Fixed an issue with the "Public if Usable" permission in the guild bank.

 - The client will now load more information upon initial zone-in to make later movement smoother.  There will be a performance hit when first zoning in, however.
 - The tracking window updates have been optimized and should be somewhat faster now.
 - Fixed issues where /guildstatus and /guildinvite were not working on players outside of proximity range.
 - The corpses of group members who die outside of proximity range should once again be targetable by clicking their name and should show on the map.
 - Fixed several issues with the /hidecorpse command:
 - - You can now hide corpses after being resurrected from hover mode.
 - - Corpses of group members not in zone will no longer be hidden with /hidecorpse allbutgroup.
 - - /hidecorpse looted will not hide your own corpse.
 - The /who guild command should now return players in the zone who are in /roleplay mode.
 - The /who count command will again work for all players in the zone.
 - Using the center view key after moving downward on a mount will no longer cause your view angle and movement angle to be out of sync.
 - Right clicking a player's name in the bazaar window will again face you towards them and generate a path.
 - Due to issues with NPCs summoning players below the world, NPCs will once again summon to their exact position.  The change will be returned once the issues are resolved.
 - Fixed a problem that was not allowing players over level 62 access to Bastion of Thunder and the Halls of Honor on the progression server.
 - Fixed a problem with access to Theatre of Blood.  You should now be able to enter Theatre of Blood at level 68.

Here's a peek at the Game Update notes for Thursday, May 22, 2008

*** Highlights ***

- The EQPlayers database has received an upgrade to improve performance.

- We have enabled player proximity again.  The proximity algorithms have been improved and tuned.  Bandwidth usage has been reduced and both client and server performance have been improved.  In addition, the delay upon first zoning in should be largely eliminated as any NPCs in your proximity on zone-in are sent by the server before you are officially in the zone (while the zoning screen is still up).




*** Items ***

- The worn effect on the following breastplates is now a reuse time reduction of Thousand Blades: Osh`vir`s Dreamponder Breastplate, Singing Energeiac Plate Breastplate, Chromasteel Breastplate of the Dream, Prismatic Skaldsong Breastplate, and Dauntless Minstrel's Hardened Breastplate.
- All types of Modulating Rods are now usable in the potion belt.


*** Spells ***

- Unholy Aura Discipline now increases the damage done by direct damage Lifetap spells.


*** Quests & Events ***

- Relm M`Loch has found another destination that she enjoys almost as much as the Plane of Hate.
- Noble's Causeway - Ferans will no longer spawn or fight inside some objects near the dead Bazu.
- Katta Castellum - Shield of Bane Warding Quest: The opening of the Sealed Runed Iron Bound Chest will now correctly spawn the reanimated Vah Shir.
- Barren Coast - Killing Maybell the Dark Flower will update her quest correctly once again.
- The Soulbleeder raid will no longer spawn if the raid has a lockout timer for successfully completing it.
- The Soulbleeder raid will now reset properly.
- Mayong's slash ability should no longer hit the player tanking him.
- Lethar's conical breath ability should always be directed at the player tanking him.


*** NPC *** 

- Zeflmin Werlikanin in the Guild Hall has found new geodes for travel. 
- Denizens of the Loping Plains are no longer stealing clockwork modulators.


*** Tradeskills ***

- Murky and Foggy energeian orbs have become less expensive to create.  Additionally, Foggy energeian orbs have become less difficult to make.
- Player-made powersources will now result in "sealed" orbs which can be right-clicked to create the actual powersources.  This will guarantee that players will get a fully-charged powersource, and allow for multiple yields on the tradeskill combine as originally intended.


*** Miscellaneous ***

- The Locker of Lupine Linking can now be used to separate an older mount from the SoF Claim item 'Mottled Worg Mount' if they have been previously combined.
- Players who worship Karana should no longer be KOS to some mobs in monster missions.
- We have enabled player proximity again.  The proximity algorithms have been improved and tuned.  Bandwidth usage has been reduced and both client and server performance have been improved.  In addition, the delay upon first zoning in should be largely eliminated as any NPCs in your proximity on zone-in are sent by the server before you are officially in the zone (while the zoning screen is still up).
- Fixed an issue that could cause players with /hidecorpse looted active to be unable to loot+.
- Fixed an issue that was causing players to go linkdead when accepting a resurrection.

*** Highlights ***

- The experience gained formulas have been modified to present players with a much smoother increase in the number of kills required to progress through a level as they gain more levels. This change has the side effect of reducing the number of kills required to gain a level in certain scenarios between levels 50 and 75.



*** AA ***

- Rank 4 of Divine Stun is now available as a Secrets of Faydwer AA.

*** Miscellaneous ***

- Improvements have been made to load balancing for instance servers that should improve peak-time performance of instances.
- Corpses should once again disappear immediately rather than fading away slowly after looting when using /hidecorpse looted even if all the items have been removed from the corpse.
