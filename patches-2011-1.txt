Here are the patch notes for today's game update (taken from the patcher):

    *** Highlights ***

    - Server Transfers

    You can now transfer your character to Firiona Vie and Zek for free!  This is a one-way server transfer and your character will not remain on the original server.
      
    - Housing Layouts

    Housing layouts allow for the saving and loading of entire sets of placed items.  When you create a look for your yard, your house, or your entire plot that you want to keep, you can save it as a layout.  You are then free to modify the plot's appearance, because at any point in the future you can easily load the layout and all available layout items will be restored to their saved positions.

    There are a number of options available when loading a layout:
    - You can store all currently placed items that aren't used in the layout or keep them where they are
    - You can use items from your inventory while loading a layout
    - You can choose to load only the house or yard portions of a layout. 

    Whenever a layout is loaded, an Auto Save layout is created of the plot's placed items right before the load was done, allowing you the ability to undo a mistaken load.  Also, in case you forget the items that went to a particular layout, there is a layout details window.  This window tells you all of the required items for a specific layout and whether or not you have enough of them available to fully load the layout with your desired settings.

    - A New Face in the Neighborhood

    An uneasy tension fills the morning air of Sunrise Hills. Garik, the recipient of five consecutive losses at Orcakar glares around the room irreverently before speaking, 'I don't much care for their kind waltzing into our home and bandying about their authority like they do...'

    Darix, the cynical antagonist, smiles, 'You sound worried, little man. You should keep your focus on the game at hand. He's not a concern to us; let him wander about crafting his knickknacks and going on about his brother...'

    Ragthar slams a small Orc figurine down on to the table and lets loose a roaring laugh, 'Me win again!' The surrounding trio sighs. Perhaps a new face in the neighborhood will introduce a bit of luck in their efforts to best the Ogre savant...

    - Tremors and Premonitions

    The rumors started, as they usually do, with the gnomes.  The Eldritch Collective buzzes with activity, and even the students are excited by something they can feel in the air.  A flurry of messages zips from sage to sage, each returning confirmed - the Order of Three, the Academy of Arcane Scientists, the Keepers of the Art, and even, surreptitiously, the Heretics - they all feel the same subtle change in the fabric of reality.

    The barrier is weakening.


    *** Zek ***

    - Zek server - The zoning protection has been changed.  A new spell called Runes of Zek now protects players as they zone.  This spell will last 18 to 24 seconds.  If the player with this spell on them moves more than 1 unit, the spell drops.  The server will not cast this spell on a player if they have already received the buff within the last minute.


    *** Items ***

    - Fixed some issues with heirloom items and augments.
    - Fixed an issue that was not properly showing the description on augments.
    - Item stacks now work properly in real estates.
    - Dwerium jewelry now properly and immediately adjusts your stats.
    - Corrected several items that could mistakenly be traded on the Firiona Vie server.


    *** Tradeskills ***

    - Cultural Treasurer Foiwom will now store/retrieve illustrious patterns.
    - Cultural Treasurer Siofra will now store/retrieve extravagant charm patterns.
    - Cultural Treasurer Siofra will now offer a cultural book task for illustrious books.


    *** Quests & Events ***

    - Cazic's Final Stand - Lowered the damage of several of Cazic's spells.
    - The Stone Warden - The warden can no longer be stunned with House of Thule spells. You'll now have to resort to charm and good looks.


    *** Spells ***

    - Fixed an issue that was causing your mana and endurance to drop when zoning while under the effects of revival sickness.
    - Ranger - Increased the Tempus Faycite Shard: Heartrend effect and adjusted the description for accuracy.
    - Rogue - Increased the Tempus Faycite Shard: Pinpoint Flaws effect to match the description.


    *** NPC ***

    - NPCs will no longer enrage at 10% life.  Pets are not affected by this change.
    - Returned the heralds of Druzzil Ro to their rightful places.
    - Straggling New Years NPCs should no longer be spawning and attacking unsuspecting travelers.

         
    *** AA ***

    - Shadowknight - Removed the spell casting restriction on Visage of Death.
    - There are significant changes to the way Headshot, Anatomy, and Finishing Blow function:
    - - Assassinate, Headshot, and Finishing Blow now increase the damage delivered with each new rank.
    - - Anatomy and Headshot now increase the maximum level of NPCs affected by 2 per rank.
    - - Headshot has 3 new levels to bring it equal with Assassinate to 19 ranks total.


    *** Achievements ***

    - Underfoot meta achievements now list the correct achievements you need to complete in order to earn them.

      
    *** Miscellaneous ***

    - Corrected Randall of the Fellows' misconceptions about the new fellowship size.
    - Pagus Nonad has joined the other merchants in Sunrise Hills.
    - Increased the number of objects you can place in your real estate plots by 50 percent.
    - Modified the real estate zones so that players not owning House of Thule are now allowed to enter them but not own or manipulate them.
    - The Loyalist merchants have changed their inventory.  They no longer sell Surefall Satchels and now they sell some 3 room houses with a 300 item limit, 200 of that vault space, and no continuing upkeep.  These will also only be available for a limited time.
    - Matched the hail range for NPCs to the same distance as the say range and corrected several visual errors with the distance check:
    - - You will no longer get a "too far away" message if the NPC did not have a hail task step for you to complete.
    - - Hailing outside of 100 feet only prevents task step completion. It does not affect normal hail responses.
    - - The error message now uses the proper formatting of the name.
    - You can now use SMS and Paypal to purchase Station Cash through the EQ UI.
    - Fixed a couple of issues where if a player equipped or unequipped a primary or secondary item slot and then camped, used /exit, or /quit, the character select screen would show the wrong weapons equipped for the character.  If the slot was previously equipped and had become unequipped, when entering the game, a ghost item would appear in the character's hand initially.  These issues should no longer occur.
    - Fixed a server disconnect that could occur when entering the tutorial with a newly-created character.
    - If you have no credit cards on file in the Marketplace the credit card on file button is now disabled with a tool tip explaining how to add a credit card.  Also fixed a bug that could cause your credit cards on file to be inaccessible.
      

    *** UI ***

    - Added the ability for buttons to have a custom "text on pressed" color. See the Real Estate Items window for usage.
    - Implemented custom text colors on buttons in the Real Estate Items window.
    - Added a button template for blue buttons.
    - Added the ability to use a defined template for the ButtonDrawTemplate instead of needing to define the template in the button.  See the Actions window for usage.
    - Implemented the button templates in the following windows: AA, Achievements, Actions, Marketplace and Real Estate Manage.
    - Fixed multiple issues that occasionally caused text clipping and resizing issues for windows using horizontal or vertical layout boxes.
    - The PvP stats window will now remember that it was closed if the done button was used to close it.
    - Added a layout tab to the Real Estate Items window to allow for layout management.
    - Converted the EQ button menu to read from the CascadeMenu.txt file in the UI folder.
    - Added Placeable option to "select by type" menu of bazaar's search window.
    - Clicking arrange left in the Extended Target window now works properly.
    - Fixed a bug that was causing valid claim items to disable the claim button when selected in the claim window.   Also fixed a bug that caused the claim button to be enabled the first time you opened the claim window even if the first claim item was not valid.

Also, they cannot have a crate placed in the house or the swap will fail.  If the swap fails they will receive an error message informing them of why.

Here are the patch notes from this morning's game update (as posted by Piestro over on the EQ Forums):

    *** New 14-Day EverQuest Trials! ***

    - Have a friend who'd like to try out EverQuest? Our new 14 day trial is now available! Go to http://everquest.com/everquest.vm and click the "Try it Now" link at the top of the screen to begin!


    *** Fellowship Experience Sharing ***

    - Ever had a friend or friends that fell behind the rest of your group because they could not play as much as the rest of you? Now you can invite them to your fellowship and enable experience sharing. This allows your combat experience to be shared with them even if they are offline!
    - The new system requires fellowship members to opt-in from the fellowship window using the new toggle XP button. There is also a new column in the list that displays the XP sharing status of all members. The fellowship leader can toggle XP sharing for anyone, or each member can toggle their own.
    - If you have fellowship XP sharing enabled, you both share and receive combat experience with other fellowship members that also have it enabled.
    - Experience splitting works very similarly to the way XP is split in a group, except without the group member count bonus.
    - Normal group level-range restrictions for getting experience also apply to fellowship XP sharing.

    *** UI ***

    - New characters get a new default UI layout that should be more functional for most classes and play styles. Existing characters will be unchanged.
    - Disabled "right click to inspect" by default for new characters.
    - Implemented some minor marketplace improvements.
    - Attached SC button to the EQ button.


    *** Changed Files ***

    - EQUI_Animations.xml
    - EQUI_EQMainWnd.xml
    - EQUI_FellowshipWnd.xml
    - EQUI_MarketplaceWnd.xml
