** Items **

- All beastlord-usable items are now useable by their requisite races
- Regular, medium quality, high quality, mithril, brellium and 
adamantite rings, as well as their enchanted versions are now 
stackable. (this time we mean it)
- Made Rune Encrusted Short Sword rentable (was No Rent, should not 
have been)
- Fixed Shadowscream and all related recipes so that they return the 
correct mallet
- Reduced the price of the Fuligan Soulstone of Innoruuk and Cloudy 
Stone of Veeshan
- Reduced the price of the first two keys for the Plane of Air
- Coterie Mask of the Dead has been retroactively changed to have 5 
charges as originally intended

to this item

** Interface **

- Added /tgb as a short version of /targetgroupbuff

- /shownames now works with the following parameters:
no parameter = display the current setting.
off = don't show player names over their heads
1 = show only first names of players
2 = show First and Last Name
3 = show First, Last, and Guild (if any)
4 = show Title (if any), First, Last, and Guild (if any)

Also, the LFG, AFK and LD tags will always show if names are not off. 
There will no longer be brackets around them, and LFG will now appear 
at the end of the name with the AFK and LD tags (instead of being a * 
at the beginning)

- A player character will always have a name over its head, even if 
they are skeletons (unless /shownames is off), with the exception of 
some rare cases when players are turned into certain NPCs 
- Added /ttell. This will send a tell to the player character that is 
currently your target. The command will also allow corpses as a valid 
target. /ttell'ing a player's corpse will auto-tell that player (this 
was actually patched earlier along with an emergency patch)
- Added IRC style '/me' as a synonym for /emote (this was actually 
patched earlier along with an emergency patch)
- Added '/send' as a synonym for /tell (this was actually patched 
earlier along with an emergency patch)

** Spells **

- Necromancer Group spells should now be working, they were only 
affecting the caster. This includes spells such as: Degeneration, 
Succession of Shadows, Crippling Claudication, and Zavfeer's Theft of 
Vitae. These spells have also had their duration increased. Mind Wrack

- NPCs that cannot be stunned will once again take damage from damaging 
stun spells (this was actually patched earlier along with an emergency 
patch)
- Critical heals and nukes now display damage numbers (this was 
actually patched earlier along with an emergency patch)

** Zones **

- Characters will no longer take falling damage when in the Bazaar
- Characters can now bind in the Nexus

** Alternate Advancement **

- Made it so the percentages of Spell Casting Fury Mastery scale a bit 
more

/smack
- Changed the automatic targeting code so that it won't automatically 
target someone that cast a beneficial spell on you

match the announcements by the Scions. This has the net effect of 
reducing the time between portal activations

** Patch Update **

Today we are sending you a couple of new DLL files that should do the 
following:

- May improve performance in indoor Luclin zones

- Should improve zoning time in many cases, especially in zones with 
many objects/trees. May also reduce the "hitch" when other players zone 
in, though it probably won't remove it completely

- May reduce the cases where some players experience a performance 
reduction after being in a zone for a while

- Fixed a bug that was causing some portions of spell effects and the 
"bolts" in bolts spells to not show up.

- Generally improve stability.

How these changes affect individuals will vary, but we hope that this 
will improve game performance a bit over all.

- Added Quest NPCs to Thurgadin, Kael and Skyshrine for Beastlord quest 
armor
- Gravel leaf tea will now fit in the combine container for the 
associated quest
- Grimling Blood should now be dropping
- Idia in the bard guild in Kelethin was telling you to turn in a quest 
item to the incorrect NPC. Changed quest text to reflect the correct 
NPC to hand the item to
- In Iceclad, Keref Spiritspear won't be so unreasonable when you 
complete the task that he asks of you
- Citizens in skyshrine no longer defend the 'vermin' spiders
- Increased the drop rate of the Staff of Elemental Mastery: Earth
- Bloody Shak Dratha Hearts should now be dropping
- Quest of Nobility should now be working properly
- Increased the spawn rate of Brother Qwinn tenfold


** Items **

- Adjusted statistics on equipment that was dropping in the Umbral 
Plains. Many of the items had AC that was inconsistent with the armor 
types of the classes. The AC has been reduced on some pieces and raised 
on others. In all instances where the AC was dropped a different 
statistic was raised. Several items received a significant upgrade 
while others were downgraded
- Also in regards to Umbral Plains armor, Ranger has been removed from 
the plate class armor that was dropping and have been added to the 
usable classes on the chain equivalent. Bards have been added to the 
plate equipment list. This might mean that some Rangers will have armor 
that they can't use. Our Customer Service personnel will trade out that 
armor for the chain equivalent
- Ghoulbane is now No-Drop
- SoulFire charges can only be used by Paladins (though they can be 
used from inventory)
- Raised the armor value on many Beastlord specific armor pieces
- Added effects to a few of the Wild Lord's armor pieces
- Added Vah Shir to Imbrued Plate Mail useable races
- Rhino Hide armor is now Druid and Monk usable
- The Crustacean Shell Shield is now magic
- Scroll of Knowledge can now be equipped in the primary, secondary, 
and range slots
- Scroll of Enlightenment can now be equipped in the primary, 
secondary, and range slots
- Thought Horror Fangs can now be thrown
- Iron Scroll of War must now be worn to activate

"range" value has been removed to prevent people from accidentally 
throwing them

other pieces
- Dark Cloak of the Sky must now be worn to activate
- Sage's Crown is now No-Drop to match every other Velious quest armor

armor

when inventory is opened
- Idol of Rallos Zek can now be used by ShadowKnights
- Helm of Grim Blessings can now be used by Wood Elves
- Flayed Skin Bracer is no longer a Lore item
- Greaves of Avoidance can now be used by all races

- Guise of the Hunter can now also be worn by human bards and rogues 
- Primal Cudgel now has the proper effect
- Added "Recommended Level" equal to the current item use level for the 
several items. All of these items require the player to be level 51+ to 
equip them and/or use their effects. Setting the "Recommended Level" 
field like this just lets the player know what level they need to be to 
use the item. The actual utility of the item was not affected in any 
way, this change is purely informational
- Several items have been changed to be not useable by Iksar. They had 
been erroneously set as Iksar useable in the last item patch. These 
were primarily items that were usable by Beastlords (and were therefore 
changed to allow all Beastlord races to use them), but that had been 
specifically restricted from use by Iksar due to their inherent armor 
value

** Zones **

- Shades in Umbral, Maiden's Eye and Vex Thall are now considered 
undead
- Placed portals to and from Great Divide and Nexus
- Added many new items to better round out the rewards for high-level 
Luclin encounters

** Horses **

- Implemented horse trade in quests. There are now four stable hands 
who will buy back specific colored bridles located in the stables in 
the Bazaar
- Being stunned will now stop players on horses. Not stopping them when 
stunned was causing warping and other bad things
- Knockback spells, and spells that throw you into the air, now affect 
people on horses properly
- Horses now levitate when their rider should.
- Fixed a bug that was causing the client to crash when attempting to 
follow someone while on a horse. /follow should also now work when the 
person you are following is on a horse

** Spells **

- Wizard Familiar spell scrolls will now increase in purchase cost with 
the spell level
- Several spells will no longer be interrupted, spells such as the 
'proc' generated by Instrument of Nife
- Several spells that were not functioning in the planes have been 
fixed and now work in the planes 
- Bards should now gain singing skill when singing and should no longer 
gain skill in an instrument when they are not using one.
- Characters are no longer damaged by damage shields when using 
throwing weapons
- Atol's Spectral Shackles has had its casting difficulty reduced
- Made some changes to Nature's Recovery to make it more stackable

** Visual Issues **

- Wolves and warders should no longer appear to be very small
- Characters no longer lose their hair or beard when their illusions 
wear off
- Weapons should now appear properly (sometimes they wouldn't show up 
at all) when a player zoned in
- Characters in wolf or bear form (or other races that aren't player 
races) should no longer have parts of them tinted based on the armor 
the player was wearing
- Bear form should now look correct to people that zoned in after the 
spell was cast on them
- May have fixed the problem with extra mouse cursor showing in game
- Fixed a problem with NPCs, PCs and some objects not being visible in 
some zones (Wakening Lands, Plane of Growth, Emerald Jungle and Swamp 
of No Hope)

** Performance Issues **

- More work on reducing zone times for Luclin city zones
- "Hitch" created when player characters enter a zone should be gone 
now
- Fixed a bug that could cause the client to crash in some cases where 
a character tried to purchase an item from a vendor but didn't have 
enough money
- Characters with pets that zone (horses, familiars and warders) should 
now be able to zone from North Qeynos to Qeynos Hills

** New Features **

- Holding shift while clicking the resolution in the options in game 
will reduce the resolution. If you are already in 640x480 though, this 
does nothing. Normal click increases the resolution as it always has 
and still wraps back to 640 after the highest resolution your machine 
supports.
- Using 1280x1024 and 1600x1200 resolutions, the /wincolor command, and 
getting the inventory window in fullview mode are now available to all 
EverQuest players (these features were restricted only to Velious 
owners) 

** PvP **

- It is no longer possible to bandage others of the opposing deity team 
on Sullon Zek

** Alternate Advancement Abilities **

- Lowered the reuse time on Rampage AA ability from 15 minutes to 10 
minutes
- Rampage is now fixed. Previously was only hitting one target
- Mass Group Buff button should work properly when zoning
- Casting Reinforcement should now work on all buffs cast, not just 
those cast on yourself
- The Discipline Duelist should now be doing the correct damage when 
using Chaotic Stab
- LifeBurn should now reset properly after being interrupted
- Dire Charm should now reset properly after being interrupted
- Fixed the Quick Buff ability to work as described
- Leech Touch should refresh properly now
- Exodus and Nexus Gate now have a casting time of 1/10th of a second

------------------------------
February 1, 2002
------------------------------

On Monday the 5th we'll be making a change to the way our Live and Test 
patching works.

A little while ago we combined our Test patcher with our Live patcher. 
The intent was to remove the confusion that having two patchers can 
cause and to encourage more people to play on Test.

Well, we're going back to the old way. We are going to split the Test 
patcher and the Live patcher back into two separate programs.

This means that in order to access the Test Server you will need to run 
TestEverQuest.exe, which you will find in your EverQuest directory. To 
play on the Live Servers just start EverQuest as you always have.

There are a few advantages to separating the two patchers. Splitting 
them up makes it a little easier, as a player, to be sure that you are 
headed to the right server when you double click the icon. It's also a 
little more intuitive for those that want to run the game in two 
directories.

Using two directories for EverQuest does use up a lot of hard drive 
space. However, for those with enough space that play regularly on both 
Test and on Live servers, this is a safer and faster way to work. Using 
the same directory means that each time you change servers (Live to 
Test or Test to Live) you will have to patch. The data on the Test 
Server is very rarely the same as that on Live servers.

And for us internally it makes it easier to test new patchers. It gives 
us one more step for testing. Now we can push a patcher to the Test 
Server and try it out there after internal testing and before it goes 
to the Live servers.

In any case, we've decided to move back to the old way. Starting on 
Monday, February 5th, 2002 you will need to run TestEverQuest.exe to 
patch and play on the Test server, and Everquest.exe to patch and play 
on the Live servers.

* Patch Message Addendum *

The command line argument "/test" should no longer be used to play on 
the Test Server. Anyone using this should remove this argument from 
their shortcut. Please manually select "TestServer" from the Advanced 
Options window to use the Test Server. On Monday, February 05, 
TestEverQuest.exe will once again be used to patch and play on the Test 
Server.

.....................................................................

------------------------------
February 13, 2002  3:00 am
------------------------------

** General **

- Improved sound for many users. Should eliminate a lot of the 
"choppy" sound issues
- Fixed one of the link-death-while-zoning bugs
- Characters who disconnect while zoning shouldn't be 'stuck' for an 
inordinate amount of time
- Renamed all will-o-wisps and will o' wisps to Fred. 
- Reconsidered and changed Fred to willowisp.
- Pets no longer pace. Pets will now, when close to you, STOP.
- Many higher level NPCs now have a random delay before they initially 
spawn. This means that they will appear at a more random time interval 
after servers or zones are brought up. This is designed to provide a 
fairer distribution of these NPCs across all time zones
- If you right click to auto-inventory an item that you are looting and 
it will not fit into your inventory, the item will simply appear on 
your cursor as if you had left clicked on it

- NPC and PC corpses can now be /considered to find out how long until 
they decay, and PC corpses additionally tell you how long you have to 
resurrect them

five, whether the player is on-line or off-line or any combination of 
the two
- Characters below level eight will no longer see light blue cons

the expansion, and therefore will no longer move you to the 'safe 
point' in the zone when it can't take you to the Nexus
- Pets can now be targeted by typing their full name after the /target 
command (or at least enough of it to distinguish it from the owner)
- Knockback now works correctly when on a horse
- Summoning a horse in Plane of Sky will no longer allow you to 
levitate
- Gating when in the same zone that you are bound no longer causes 
problems

'safe point'

Runed Totem quests


** Spell Related **

- Eye of Zomm and Eye of Tallon are now non-KoS in a fashion similar to 
familiars
- Koadic's Endless Intellect stacking has been fixed. If a player has 
Koadic's Endless Intellect on them and anyone casts Breeze, Clarity, 
Clarity 2, Boon of the Clear Mind, Gathering of the Mind, or Gift of 
Pure Thought on them, it will fail and the Koadic's will remain.
- Mind Wrack gives mana instead of taking mana away
- Charm is immediately removed from charmed NPC's when the character 
that charmed them casts invisibility
- Made some small improvements to Marzin's Mark
- Corrected some stacking issues with Nature's Recovery

has a lower level character targeted. 
- Egress should once again force a 'zone' to clear aggro
- The damage component of Elnerick's Entombment of Ice no longer causes 
the spell to have a chance at breaking its root component

- Act of Valor should now work properly

improved familiar that is better then the greater familiar and is very 
resistant to all spells. It is not immune to spells though, just 
extremely resistant.
- Warcry should now work properly
- Life Burn now considers hit points from items and should no longer be 
interrupted
- Area Taunt should be no longer affect creatures on heights or floors 
above and below the warrior

different graphic

- Dark Cloak of the Sky from 'worn to activate' to 'Race/Class to

properly now

** Firiona Vie **

- The Trivial Loot Code present on the Roleplaying server will no 
longer affect items that are marked solely with the No-Drop flag. No-
Drop items that are also Magic or Lore will continue to behave as they 
did prior to this patch.

- The EverQuest Team

** Tales **

Grand Master Glox sat silently staring into the black waters of the 
Cabilis aqueducts, his thoughts tracing and retracing the recent 
visions that had upset his nights. The Lord Cazic was trying to tell 
him something, but he could not yet decipher what it was. The hand on 
his shoulder startled him and he turned quickly, striking the intruder 
with a quick blow to the chest. The figure crumpled to the cold ground.

Glox stood over him with a look of horror, it was one of his own pupils 
he had struck. He lay bloodied and bruised at Glox's feet breathing 
heavily with much effort, he was obviously dying. The pupil reached up 
toward Glox with something in his hand. Glox took the items from his 
hand and peered at them intently. There were two items, one was a 
glistening serpentine scale, the other an ancient stone symbol. Glox 
recognized the symbol almost immediately with horror. It was the symbol 
of the Soriz, the ancient Iksar tribe that had been the slaves of the 
Shissar empire. Glox looked down at his pupil again. "Where did you get 
this?" The dying Iksar used his last ounce of energy to point up toward 
the night sky and the moon of Luclin. "sSs... Ssraeshza... has... 
returned..."

February 25, 2002  3:00 am
------------------------------

- Fixed a problem with the Gnome sitting animation

- Fixed a bug that was causing some people to crash when repeatedly 
right-clicking spell gems

- Made adjustments for Quellious monks attempting to do Iksar Shackle 
quests

- Fixed a bug in the way that Alternate Experience was being 
distributed. Extra experience was being generated for an ungrouped 
character with all experience going to the Alternate Experience pool. 
Too little experience was going into the Alternate Experience pool for 
people grouped that were applying less than 100% of their experience to 
the Alternate Experience pool.

- Fixed stacking issues with Circle of Seasons and Talisman of 
Epuration

- Wild Lord's armor effects are now level restricted

- Fixed a bug with necromancer pets that was preventing them from 
gaining the healing benefit of lifetaps. It turns out that this was 
affecting all NPCs. It should now be working properly for both pets and 
NPCs.

------------------------------

** Patch Information ***

- Fixed a problem with Alternate Advancement ability Combat Fury that 
was causing rangers using archery and rogues using throwing to have a 
lesser chance to critical than normal. This did not affect warriors

- We think we've fixed many of the issues that were causing 1018 
errors. At the very worst players should be able to log back in faster 
now 

- Fixed a problem that was causing quests to give no Alternate 
Experience to a character when that character had all experience going 
into their Alternate Experience pool

- Fixed a bug that was causing Claw of the Savage Spirit, Earthen Band 
and Breastplate of Day to show a negative statistic modifier

- Fixed an issue with some ATI-based video cards that was causing the 
inventory screen to flash

- All Levitation spells will now be stripped when entering a no-
levitation zone. There was a bug that caused the game to only strip the 
first Levitation spell found

- Fixed a bug that was displaying erroneous and duplicate faction 
messages

- Also added some Tradeskill recipes for items dropping in Akheva and 
Maidens eye

** A Tale **

Prime Heirophant Vek leaned over and looked into the jeweled case 
silently. The young mystic behind him nervously fingered the cudgel 
hanging from his belt. He knew what was coming. The hold of the 
faceless had firmly taken hold of his heart and was beginning to 
squeeze.

Vek turned to him quietly and simply said, "Find them." He then walked 
silently out of the room.

Hierophant Zand turned to the young Mystic, "Do as he has asked. Do not 
return until you have the skulls of the ancients in your possession." 
The young Mystic stumbled as he ran out of the room, visibly shaking.

Zand looked down into the empty skull case. Something glittered softly 
in the corner of the case. Zand reached in and picked up a small 
earring, emblazoned with the symbol of the Kunzar.

Zand walked quietly out of the room, and somewhere the soul of a dead 
emperor laughed with unholy malice.

** Another Tale **

Halor slashed frantically at the creature before him. He swung down 
hard, cleaving the great worm in two. Unfortunately there were many 
more were that came from. Bauric climbed over a rock and stood next to 
Halor, fighting off another of the worms.

Halor suddenly felt a sharp pain in his right heel and spun violently 
around, causing his journals to fly out of his pack and onto the hard 
stone floor. He swung at the worm larva with his sword knocking it 
away, but too late. The worm had wounded him badly, he could no longer 
hold himself up on the wounded ankle and he fell to the floor with a 
crash. Bauric cried out in pain as one of the larger worms bit into his 
arm. That was the last thing Halor saw before the horde of worms 
squirmed across the stones and overcame them.

We wanted to start by letting everyone know how grateful we are for all

fizzle 
- Judgement has been improved to make it a better upgrade from the

with the single target versions of those spells.

Disease/Poison work

reward associated with the encounter 

** Items **

- Wand of Casual Blessings is not longer usable by Half-Elves, and is 
usable by Dark Elves and Gnomes. It also now looks like a staff and not 
a bag

type are no longer displaying a graphic (as intended) and the 
'customized' plate helms should all now have graphics (also as 
intended)

the armor set

** Combat ** 

- Pets are now more likely to avoid NPC ripostes 
- Wizards now have an inherent chance to score a critical blast with 
their damage spells after 11th level. This ability does not lessen the 
chance of scoring a critical hit with Alternate Experience abilities 
that grant criticals 

** Client/Interface ** 

- Added /dopropertinting command. This command allows you to turn on 
and off the "DoProperTinting" option in the eqclient.ini file. 
Activating this command should correct most tinting issues (such as 
armor tint also tinting the character's skin). But if it causes issues 
you can toggle it off by using /dopropertinting off 
- Added /chat commands, that allow players to create their own chat 
channels. Please read the eqmanual_supplement.doc in your EverQuest 
directory for more information 
- Added /hitsmode command. This command allows you to more finely 
control how you see hits, including seeing them in a window other than 
your chat window. Please see the eqmanual_supplement.doc for more 
details 
- Added /clearhits to clear the current hits in the M2-M5 modes of the 
/hitsmode command. Again, please see the eqmanual_supplement for more 
information 
- Added /showgrass command. This toggles the radial flora (Luclin only) 
on and off 
- Added options in the Options screen (under Chat Filter) for filtering 
out Melee and Spell criticals. Options are All/Me/Off. These can also 
be activated using the /filter command, and will affect critical hit, 
critical blast, exceptional heal, and crippling blow messages 
- Changed /filter to allow you to toggle the various chat filter 
settings (still also lets you toggle the badwords filter) 
- Changed /channel to allow you to set your default chat channel. It 
also now saves this setting in the INI file 
- Changed the /targetgroupbuff command to be 'persistent'. The state of 
the switch will be stored in the eqclient.ini file and will be 
remembered when you log out or zone 
- Fixed the double messages received when "Soandso's song ends" 
- Mend should be working properly. "Can not use Mend for x seconds" can 
still appear, but you now should be able to use mend at the appropriate 
time 
- Fixed bug in the client that caused a "You are out of Ammo message" 
even when you still had ammo 
- Messages should no longer be lost while you are zoning 
- Corpses that are made to appear at the "safe spot" of a zone for any 
reason can now be moved using /corpse as long as the person using the 
command has /consent for that corpse 
- Added "AllLuclinPcModelsOff" line to the eqclient.ini file which, if 
set to TRUE, will skip the loading of all of the Luclin PC models 
(except the Vah Shir, which always gets loaded no matter what this is 
set to). This should allow players to set the loading of each race and 
sex individually for their normal game play, but then quickly turn all 
models off for a raid or other such circumstances 
- Added /rtarget function (can be used as /rt). This function targets 
the last character to send you a /tell. It follows all of the rules for 
/target 
- Messages sent to you while you are zoning should be saved and sent to 
you when you reach the other side of the zone. Messages should no 
longer be lost while zoning (unless zoning takes more than about 10 
minutes for any reason) 
- You should be able to keep typing whatever you were in the middle of 
typing when you zoned... but it might not be processed till you're in 
the new zone 
- If someone is on your ignore list and they do a /random, you 
shouldn't see it anymore 

** Pathing ** 

- Corrected some pathing in Ak'Anon that was preventing some NPCs from 
reaching certain areas 
- Corrected some pathing issues in Acrylia Caverns 
- Corrected a problem with the entrance from Hollowshade Moor into 
Paludal Caverns that was preventing Beastlord Warders from entering the 
zone 

** Miscellaneous ** 

- Many cases where characters would stab themselves with their weapons 
when sitting should have been eliminated.
- Player characters no longer broadcast their location when they are 
stationary. This should reduce the resources used and improve gameplay.
- Fixed a problem that was causing some users to see blocky, unblended 
terrain where terrain types meet.
- Critical hit messages from spells now take into account PvP damage 
calculations. The actual damage was calculated correctly, it was just 
displaying wrong on the critical message.
- Fixed canoes, they should move forward and backwards normally again.
- We have been working to prevent characters from being stuck in the 
game after link death in such a way that prevents the player from 
logging back in. Players should be able to log back in no more than 5 
minutes after going link dead in all situations.
- Added Sharvahl as a "home zone" for Vahshir when taking PvP racial 
faction hits into account .
- We have fixed the ATI flashing problem that some players with certain 
cards were having when inventory window was up.

March 21, 2002  3:00 am
------------------------------

Contact buffs have once again been disabled for bards to prevent songs 
from locking up 

- Fixed a bug that was causing the "Soandso begins to cast a spell" 
message to not display 

- Fixed the bug that was causing the last hit message for another 
player to be displayed even if you had other's hits off 

- Added more info to the /hitsmode help 

- Added another option to the /hitsmode command to allow users to force 
the windows to be displayed even if empty 

New Hitsmode Usage: /hitsmode    
   
    

Where:  is 1 to force the window to draw even if empty. 

- Changed it so hitsmode windows do NOT draw when in "normal" old UI 
mode (e.g. spellbook) 

- Fixed a bug that was giving bards an error message related to 
/targetgroupbuff every time they zone. ("This ability does not work 
with bard songs.")

.....................................................................

** Graphics Engine Update **

- S3 video cards: We've worked around a shortcoming in the S3 drivers 
that fixes the overlapping or "cutout" looking interface graphics.

*** News from the Vale ***

Clan Death Fist has long had a minor presence in the Misty Thicket, 
preying on the Halfling farmers and tradesmen. Recently the Death Fist 
Clans numbers in the thicket have increased and the Orcs are cutting 
down trees and mining the rock of the nearby mountains. Reports have 
come in to Rivervale that the Orcs are shipping the lumber and ore to 
the commonlands and stockpiling it for an unknown purpose. Whatever the 
Deathfists agenda, their increased presence has made the thicket a more 
dangerous place beyond the protective wall. 

Not far from the tunnel that leads from the Misty Thicket to Rivervale 
lie mysterious cursed ruins. All that remains of what once stood at 
these sites are fragments of walls that are presumed to have been 
constructed around the same time as the nearby ruined tower. An ancient 
magical scarecrow stands at the center of one of these ruins and warns 
passers by that the place is cursed. It is a popular belief among the 
halflings of Rivervale that the crumbled walls once surrounded 
beautiful and fruitful gardens that were cursed when their owner and 
caretaker offended the Gods. Whether or not this story is true, the 
scarecrows warning is true as the gardens are host to diseased vermin 
and the animated corpses of fallen halflings who were brought to the 
there and buried after their death by an unknown evil.

With the Goblin Clan Pickclaws now occupying a portion of Runnyeye 
Citadel the number of Goblins now residing in the Misty Thicket has 
grown. These somewhat exiled Runnyeye Goblins have been mining Crude 
Iron Ore from the nearby mountains and are most likely attempting to 
forge weapons and armor to use in a goblin revolt to reclaim all of 
Runnyeye Citadel from the Pickclaws. With enemies to all sides these 
semi-exiled goblins are being far less troublesome than they have the 
potential to be.

April 23, 2002  3:00 am
------------------------------

NOTE: We are unable to patch "code" right now because we are in the 
middle of making some changes to the basic structure of the game. This 
will delay fixes for system bugs and updates (such as Alternate 
Advancement Abilities and /commands). Please be patient until we can 
get these much-needed changes finished. Because these changes affect 
things such as the database that stores player characters, we're taking 
care to make these changes the right way.

May 8, 2002  3:00 am
------------------------------

- We've made some changes that will cause a few proccing items to be 
out of charges after the patch. Players with such items will need to 
petition and ask a GM to swap the item out with a new one
- Focus items using the "Naki's Pernicity" effects should now be 
working as intended
- Focus items that affect a spell's duration should now work for 
clickable items

targeted 
- Divine Glory received a small upgrade to make it more in line with 
the spell series

** Spell Filters **

- Player characters will now always see spells that hit them and spells 
they cast

spell casting messages for people in their group and they will also see 
when member of their group are hit with spells

hits

** Spell Stacking **

General stacking changes: Some buffs were not being allowed to stack 
which now will stack, and other buffs were being allowed to stack which 
should not have. 

For example, many stacking problems with spells that have a See 
Invisible or Levitate component are now gone (e.g. Dead Man Floating), 
while a number of stacking exploits that granted too much regeneration,

illusion

reduction

the in-game help (5, 15 and 25%)

now work for clickable items

slightly improve the functionality of the Evade skill

breaks sneak and/or hide because he is looting a corpse
- Beastlords should function like other hybrids when casting in melee

- Fixed a pathing bug in Fungus Grove
- Fixed a spot where characters could get stuck in Twilight Sea
- Moved the Permafrost 'safe point' closer to the zone line
- Addressed an issue with an aggressive NPC that appeared outside of 
the Arx Building in Sanctus Seru
-Modified the Vyzh`dra the Cursed spawn trigger to make the various 
incarnations more accessible

** Quests **

- Adjustments have been made to the 8th Coldain Prayer Shawl quest
- High Priestess Alexandriana should be working properly now

** Tradeskills **

- Added over 1,000 new tradeskill recipes for all levels of skill, 
along with many recipe books. A few of the vendors of Norrath might be 
able to get you started on your way 
- Added Mortar and Pestle to a Thurgadin merchant
- Rubbing Alcohol is now available from a vendor in Thurgadin

** Guilds **

- Fixed many bugs with the guild system, for example: GMs can now 
rename guilds without the need to destroy and recreate them, guilds can 
have names that share the first 15 characters with another guild (they 
couldn't before) and people should no longer experience random guild 
kickouts when a guild on their server is deleted/reformed.

** Pets **

- A character may now have a horse, a pet and an Eye of Zomm at the 
same time
- /pet attack range has been limited to prevent its use as a targeting 
tool. Asking pets to attack targets outside the range will generate a 
"not a legal target" message
- Pets will once again tell you who they are attacking by sending its 
master a /tell
- Pet attack animations should now be working for all pets

** Chat Channels **

- Players can specify a chat channel as their default channel using the 
/channel commands (e.g. /channel chat mychannel)
- The 'old' method for setting the default channel is also now saved in 
the INI file
- Kick and Invite should be working for chat channels

** Horses **

- Potions now work while on a horse
- Skeletons can now ride horses (meaning: PCs should be able to mount 
and ride horses while changed into a skeleton)

** Miscellaneous **

- Fixed a bug that was causing the AFK flag to sometimes not be visible 
to players entering a zone after it was turned on
- Made some adjustments to factions to make Beastlords, Druids and 
Rangers (as well as small adjustments for Vah Shir) a little better 
liked by animals (those that don't adhere to a faction)
- No updates are sent when the player character is not moving, saving 
resources. We've also increased the rate that position updates are made 
by moving player characters, using up some of those saved resources but 
making movement a bit smoother
- Stationary NPCs should no longer warp when they aggro/summon
- NPCs who shout names while they Death Touch should be fixed
- Teleports arriving in some zones should spread the arrivals out a bit 
more. Affected zones are Nexus, Skyfire, Emerald Jungle, Butcherblock 
Mountains, South Ro, Greater Faydark, Tox, North Karana, West Commons 
and Lavastorm
- Fixed the bug that was preventing players from seeing the "your spell 
is interrupted" or the NPCs spell interruption message
- Fixed the issue with boats depositing players at the safe point of 
the zone after zoning
- Fixed the strange floating NPC bug (seeing NPCs floating in the air 
after zoning)
- /cry is now working
- /consent %t should allow the consented character to drag your corpse
- Target Nearest NPC (F8 by default) has been fixed.

** Sullon Zek Rules Change **

We have increased the number of character that can be created on an 
account to three. These characters, however, must be on the same team

** Firiona Vie Rules Changes **

Since the launch of Firiona Vie we have had tremendous support for this 
special server from players who want a very roleplaying immersive 
environment. Players have made numerous suggestions to tweak the 
ruleset a little more. We have taken many of those suggestions and made 
changes accordingly. 

We will be keeping the following rules intact: 

* /ooc will remain unavailable to remind people that acting in 
character is strongly recommended. 
* The Common language will remain out, to help maintain the feeling of 
race-based community and to allow people to continue to roleplay 
someone with a native tongue. 
* The Trivial Loot Code and all of the special rules for no-drop items 
will remain. This has worked out nicely for the sense of community on 
the server. 
* The one character per account restriction will remain.

However, we will be removing the following restrictions:

* Anonymous/roleplay flags will no longer be required. They will remain 
available, but forcing anonymity on characters was causing undue 
problems finding groups and other such things that are essential to 
enjoyable gameplay. 
* The language learning limit/speed restrictions will be removed. While 
the idea of limited languages seemed like a good idea, this is another 
item that was just making it too hard to actually play the game. 
Roleplayers that don't want their characters to be overly literate 
always have the option to play their characters that way. 
* /shout and /auction have returned to unrestricted use to allow easier 
grouping and selling. People are welcome to filter those channels if 
they prefer not to see them, but the benefits of having them availabe 
is just too great. /ooc will remain disabled on this server. Obviously, 
acting in character on any channel is strongly recommended. 
* Alignment restrictions has been removed. Forced restrictions for 
grouping make playing the game too much of a chore. Characters, 
however, may always decide who they wish to group with based on any 
factors the character perceives. If your Dark Elf won't group with a 
paladin, he doesn't have to (and shouldn't). If your cleric of 
Quellious wants to heal a necromancer because healing people is the 
right thing to do for him, then you should be able to do so. But not 
allowing these things is a restriction on your ability to play that 
character 'in-character', and a real hindrance to general gameplay.

Again, it's important to understand that this is still a roleplaying 
preferred server. The rules that we are changing were often as much of 
a restriction to one's ability to roleplay as they were a help. And the 
artificial barriers to grouping, especially the trouble created in just 
finding a group, needed to be removed to allow people to actually play 
the game.

** Gameplay **

- In hopes of providing more things for more people to do, certain raid 
level encounters in the world now return to existence a small amount 
faster than they used to. This was actually included in lastnight's 
patch but was not mentioned.

- To address the competition between epic-seeking bards and other 
classes, the infamous White Dragon Scale is no longer used in the quest 
given by Karam Dragonforge in Rathe Mountains. The quest now requires a 
White Dragon Hide. We did not reduce the rate at which White Dragon 
Scales enter the world, but rather added new potential for the new 
White Dragon Hide to be found.

** Focus Items **

- Spell casting time foci should report their new casting time 
properly.

- Spell duration foci designed to affect DoTs (the Affliction line) 
should now work reliably.

- Spell duration foci affecting beneficial spells are no longer random. 
They now always extend the affected buffs for their maximum. (We never 
wanted to make it harder to time your buffs.)

- The Affliction focus line should now only be affecting spells that do 
damage.

- Bards should no longer get focus item messages that weren't actually 
affecting them.

- We've re-assigned quite a few of the focus items to have their 
originally intended effect. 

All of the same items have focus effects. However, as many people 
noticed, quite a few effects were mis-assigned due to a tools error. 
(Common, mid level items were frequently being assigned high level 
effects, and vice versa.) 

This situation has been fixed, and the items now have the effects that 
we originally planned for them.

** Firiona Vie **

- Your server should once again have Trivial Loot Code enabled. Sorry 
for changing the rules on you.

** Chat Channels **

- Should once again work reliably for people who are using NAT or IP 
Masquerading via certain networking devices.

fixed
