Here are the patch notes for this morning's game update (from the patcher):

    *** Highlights ***

    - Changed the "Return Home" time to 18 minutes since the last time you logged in.  Previously you had to wait 6 hours to use this button.  Now it's set to the same time as Origin without any use of the hastened AAs.

EverQuest: Rain of Fear, EQ's 19th expansion, is all set to launch!

As of this posting, servers are expected to be down until around 10:00 A.M. Pacific Time (1:00 P.M. Eastern Time). (We all know that could be +/- a few hours, of course.)

In the meantime, you may want to check out some tips for getting started in Rain of Fear (with links to our posted guides) and read over the game update notes posted below here (these are taken from the patcher):

    *** EverQuest: Rain of Fear ***

    - The power of Fear, captured from its home plane by the Alarans and now freed from the grasp of the Triumvirate, is falling back to Norrath's surface in crystallized form.  The largest fragment of this power crashed on Alaris, very near to Erillion, the City of Bronze, but other powerful shards are falling elsewhere across the continents.  A new pathway is open outside of Erillion that leads to Shard's Landing, where followers of Cazic-Thule vie with other power-seekers in an attempt to restore their god.  Norrath's heroes are called into this conflict to prevent the rise of an even greater danger than the Triumvirate.

    *** Highlights ***

    - EverQuest's 19th expansion, Rain of Fear, has launched!  You can reach Shard's Landing by traveling through Erillion, the City of Bronze, or seek out new lands that other crystal impacts have revealed around the globe!
    - Rain of Fear raises the level cap to 100.
    - Added Slayer and Collection Achievements.  Slayer achievements will update when you kill the listed NPC.  Collection achievements will update when you right click the item.
    - Added the Aggro Meter to display your current aggro rating in comparison to the most hated on an NPC.

    *** Slayer / Collect Achievements ***

    - When killing an NPC that is part of a Slayer achievement, you'll automatically get updated and your current kill counts can be viewed in the achievement window.
    - A collectible item will have the "Collectible" tag in the item display window.
    - To collect an item, right click on the item. When collecting an item you'll receive a notification message.
    - Added "Collectible" as a filter option for "Select by Type" in the bazaar window and also alphabetized the type list.

    *** Aggro Meter ***

    - The new Aggro Meter displays your current percentage of hate compared to the entity that is most hated by the NPC that is the focus of the meter.  By default, this shows your current target, but the current aggro target can also be locked so that it won't change when you change your current target.
    - The meter can be toggled open and closed using the EQ button, /aggrometer, or by assigning a key binding to it.
    - Aggro meter displays can be toggled in the Player, Group, Target, and Extended Target Window using the right click menu for each window.
    - Added the ability to set the low, warning, and most hated colors for the aggro ratings.  By default they are green, yellow, and red for low, warning, and most hated.
    - Added the slash command /aggrolock that functions just like "Set Aggro Target" on the Aggro Meter.

    *** Autonomous Brokering ***

    - You will now be able to purchase items from a bazaar trader directly from the Bazaar Search Window if you own Rain of Fear.
    - You will now be able to barter using the Barter Search Window if you own Rain of Fear.
    - You will now be able to open The Bazaar Search and Barter Search windows using key bindings, EQ button commands, and the slash commands from any zone.
    - You can now enter Offline Mode when in buyer or trader mode using the slash command or the "Offline Mode" button in the UI.  This will allow you to remain in this mode while EverQuest is not running.
    - Offline transactions for each purchase / sale will output when you return from offline mode.
    - Added in a confirmation for going into Offline Mode.  You can turn off this confirmation in the Options window.
    - Added in key bindings, EQ button commands, and removed UI restrictions on opening the Bazaar / Trader Search window.
    - Each trader item will now appear as the stack size that is for sale.  Previously the search results would return the total count of all of that item for sale in one line in the window.
    - Implemented a max results per trader filter in the Bazaar Search window.
    - Made some changes to the Bazaar Search window to make it look more like the Merchant window.
     - - Added a "Preview" button.

    - Additional Hero's Forge robes have arrived! They are now available for the Ebon, Viridian, Violet, Beryl, and Auburn armor sets.
    - Removed erroneous text from some augments which stated a solvent was required to remove them.

    *** Tradeskills ***

    - Hero's Forge violet cloth robes are now able to be crafted.
    - Recipes that require a container as a component will now allow for auto-combine when the required container is in any container.

    *** Quests & Events ***

    - Increased the drop rate of the fear shards collected by Magus Burlshin.
    - The Chaotic Vortex used in the Agnarr event in the Bastion of Thunder should once again teleport you when you right click it.
    - Frostfell events will run from December 7th, 2012 to January 8th, 2013.

    *** Spells ***

    *** Progression Servers ***

Here are the patch notes for this morning's game update (taken from the patcher):

    *** Highlights ***

    - New hats have arrived in celebration of Frostfell! Adventurers with the Hero's Forge feature can now wear a variety of hat ornamentations that have a chance to drop from all mobs in non-raid zones.
    - Player Studio Items will be live on December 13th! Check the Marketplace then to see what's new!
    - Fixed an issue that was causing the Small Bright Fear Shards in Shard's Landing to become unavailable over time. These shards will also spawn more frequently.
    - New AA upgrades have been added. See the AA section below for more details.


    *** Items ***

    - Player Studio Items will be live on December 13th! Check the Marketplace then to see what's new!
    - New hats have arrived in celebration of Frostfell! Adventurers with the Hero's Forge feature can now wear a variety of hat ornamentations that have a chance to drop from all mobs in non-raid zones.  
    - Fixed an issue that was causing the Small Bright Fear Shards in Shard's Landing to become unavailable over time. These shards will also spawn more frequently.
    - All Rain of Fear equipment with appearances can now be placed in housing.
    - Bard focus spells have been added to several armor pieces that were missing them.
    - Several missing spells have been located and returned to their items.
    - Corrected several item naming errors.


    *** Quests & Events ***

    - Subdued Subjects - Luring a subdued spinechiller to Veldmir should now properly update the task, regardless of whether you have brought him a subdued orc already.

    *** Spells ***

    - Cleric - Corrected the spell landed message of Symbol of Gezat.

    *** Achievements ***

    - Corrected an error that granted a blank achievement upon logging in to the game.

    *** UI ***

    - Modified the Item Inspect window and the Marketplace window to support Player Studio items.
    - Changed some text related to bazaar delivery to no longer reference "mailbox" when it should be "parcels."
    - Fixed a merchant stack issue where selling an item to a merchant that already has the item was using the stack size as the quantity that the merchant had.

    - Changed -
    EQUI_Animations.xml
    EQUI_BazaarConfirmationWnd.xml
    EQUI_ItemDisplay.xml
    EQUI_MarketplaceWnd.xml
