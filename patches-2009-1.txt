*** Spells ***

- A new Monk discipline has been implemented named Calanin's Synergy.
- Fixed a bug that would cause some disciplines to lock out certain AAs. An example of this is the Rogue ability Bleed locking out the Rogue AA Escape.

*** Quests ***

- Made some tuning changes to Tower of Discord Raids 4 and 5.
- Slightly modified the tether box for the Crystalline Tyranont.
- The chest in the Old Blackburrow raid should now display properly.
- The Ikaav Entrancement spell will be slower to spread, easier to resist and have a smaller infectious radius, as well as a shorter duration.

*** AAs ***

- Added a wear off message to the Heal over Time component of the higher level ranks of Lay on Hands.
- Adjusted the slot order for the AA effect Third Spire of Nature Effect to resolve a stacking issue.
- Corrected an issue with the last 3 ranks of Army of the Dead AA (Necro) that had removed several melee skills from the newest ranks of swarm pets.
- Corrected an issue with the last 3 ranks of the Swarm of Decay AA (Necro) that was causing the wrong spell to be cast by the NPCs.
- Modified the Slot order on the AAs Third Spire of Ancestors and Third Spire of the Savage Lord to resolve some stacking issues.
- Several AAs that used the Skill Damage Amount bonus, specifically from the "Spire" lines, have had the values retuned to better match the intended damage returns from these abilities.

*** Mercenaries ***

- Mercenaries will no longer charge you if you have had them in passive stance for a complete billing period and you zone.
- Mercenaries will now be taken into consideration for player counting in dynamic zones if mercenaries are allowed into these dynamic zones.
- Fixed some problems that caused mercenaries to incorrectly think they were still in combat.
- Healer mercs will now retry a resurrect more quickly if the initial resurrect fails while the target player is zoning.
- Added timed mercenary debug logging. If you submit a /bug with type Mercenaries or use /merclog, the next 20 seconds of actions and decisions made by your mercenary will be logged. Please use /bug to describe what you perceive the problem is, so we can determine what we're looking at with the log.
- Changed PvP calculations so that mercenaries being hit from PCs or other mercenaries take full damage with no mitigation, avoidance or resist checks. They also no longer resist stuns from PCs or other mercenaries.
- Fixed a bug that was causing corpses to poof with no experience if a mercenary whose owner was dead in hover mode was the first on the hate list (it didn't necessarily have to do the most damage).

*** Miscellaneous ***

- Enabled the environmental sound toggle on ambient sounds in the following zones: Abysmal Sea, Ashengate, Direwind, Dreadspire (and Demi-Plane of Blood), Ikkinz, Lavastorm Mountains, Kod'Taz, Tipt, and Vxed. The Master still commands his orchestra, however.
- The gnomes have made an adjustment to their cannons in Dragonscale Hills that should hopefully make them a bit more reliable.

- Twincast will no longer fire on detrimental spells used on another player (PvP).
- Players will no longer receive diagnostic messages about loading database strings when first logging in.
- Fixed a bug with experience gained while in a group with a shrouded member. Under certain conditions, experience could be either way too high for the shrouded player, or way too low for the unshrouded player.
- When inviting another player to a raid, if the player rejects your invitation, you will now receive a message stating that your invitation was rejected.
- Added a popup confirmation dialog (that can be switched off in the options menu) when you are invited to a raid.

- Fixed a bug that left pets in the world when you kicked yourself off when logging in.

- Spell recast timers should now be fixed in most cases. After this change, if your spell does not land or gets interrupted for any reason, you will be able to immediately cast the spell again.
- AA points banked are now limited to 30 even when you are shrouded.

** Login ***

- Fixed an issue that was causing the kick request prompt to disappear after 5 seconds and default to accept the kick request of a player logging in with the same account.
- Added an option in the general options page to allow a player to set their client to automatically accept kick requests from others logging in with the same account. This is helpful for those that might frequently play from two locations. They can set their clients to automatically accept their kick request (without this option set, your client will default to denying the request).

*** UI ***

- Added a toggle to turn off the new left click camera functionality.
- Fixed a bug that caused potions to not grey out when they had a recast timer under certain circumstances.
- Fixed an issue with the left-button getting stuck when in 3rd person camera mode. This could happen if you cast a spell with a hotkey while rotating the camera using the left mouse button.
- The third person camera will now always turn the character when in mouse walk mode. (Formerly going into mouse walk mode from the left button behaved differently than going into mouse walk mode from the right button.)
- Fixed issue with third person camera not resetting to behind the head when changing from first person.

February 11, 2009

From the patcher:

*** Highlights ***

- Buffs that have a levitation effect are no longer stripped when you enter zones marked as no-levitate. When you enter a no-levitate zone, you will receive a message that the levitation effect has been disabled. Additional effects provided by the buffs (if any) will remain enabled. This means that levitation buffs that have other effects connected to them (i.e. Spirit of the Eagle's speed boost effect) can now be used in a no-levitate zone.

- The armor sets for Seeds of Destruction have been modified to improve the balance of stats for the individual pieces while adding more consistency within the sets.

*** Zones ***

- Banners can no longer be used to teleport into Discord Raids. They can still be placed for stats.

*** Mercenaries ***

- Fixed a problem with the tank merc AI that caused the merc (when set to main tank) to get in a loop trying to bazu bellow its target, - when a number of other targets nearby are mezzed cause it to not actually attack.
- Mercenary healers will now be much more interested in healing you when you are out of combat.

*** Miscellaneous ***

- Bard instrument mods are now using the focus system. All bard instruments now have a focus effect that amounts to the same bonus the instrument was getting previously. The display is somewhat different. As an example, prior to this change, a percussion mod of 28 was a 2.8x multiplier on effects. This will now be displayed as a focus effect like "Percussion Resonance 18" that gives a 180% boost to percussion. This is equivalent to the original 2.8x multiplier.
- Bard songs can now be capped individually and a system has been put in place to allow much better scaling of bard song effects and focuses in the future.

- Some versions of Zebuxoruk will now sell Temporal Polymorphic Cells. These cells will transform a Luminescence to an Incandescence and vice versa.
- Tavid Dennant in the guild lobby has a limited amount of items that players can use to alter their Seeds of Destruction Armor. He does not sell these like the quest items he holds, but will give them to you if you talk to him about [items].
- Zebuxoruk now sells purity augments for chronobines.
- Fixed a problem with shared banks that caused items to be lost on the Firiona Vie server (mostly).
- Buffs that have a levitation effect are no longer stripped when you enter zones marked as no-levitate. When you enter a no
-levitate zone, you will receive a message that the levitation effect has been disabled. Additional effects provided by the buffs (if any) will remain enabled. This means that levitation buffs that have other effects connected to them (i.e. Spirit of the Eagle's speed boost effect) can now be used in a no-levitate zone.
- Fixed a problem with reagent preservation focuses that cause them to only preserve one reagent instead of preserving all the reagents requires for the spell if it required more than one. This specifically fixes the problem with Axe of the Eradicator.

March 12, 2009
------------------------------

Here is the patch message from today:

*** Highlights ***

- Guild Creation Tool: Players can now get their guilds created in-game by using the Guild Management window. When opening the Guild Management Window (Alt + G) when you are not in a guild, you will be asked if you would like to create one. All existing guild naming rules still apply. Only one guild is permitted per server per account. Guilds cannot be created while in a shroud.

- Pet Window Improvements: The functionality of the Pet Window has been improved by allowing players to customize each button individually. These changes also allow players to add commands that they pick up via AAs. We've also added some new commands including a pet hold command. (See UI: Pet Window Improvements below)

- Enhanced Raid Window: We've updated the raid management window to allow for sorting and expedition / shared task management improvements. Also added AFK, dead, and out of zone status. (See UI: Enhanced Raid Window below)

*** Items ***

- Nakk's Enduring Bauble now looks just like the gem from a ring, instead of a ring.
- The Durus Faycite Shard: Gorenaire's Chant of Frost, and Durus Faycite Shard: Talendor's Chant of Flame now increase the duration of their respective songs by 1 tick instead of increasing the damage.

*** Spells ***

- Cantata of Rodcet now increases HP and Mana regen by 61/70/75 and 50/58/62 for Ranks 1/2/3, up from 51/60/65 and 42/50/54
- Fixed a problem with Performance resonance that was causing it to focus a number of effects that it shouldn't have.
- Lowered the endurance cost on Wheel of Fists to 253/288/307 down from 316/360/384.
- Lowered the endurance cost on Whorl of Fists to 308/351/374 down from 385/439/468.
- Modified the stacking order of the Calanin's Synergy discipline to better stack with other similar abilities including the effect from Deceivers Blight Strike and other spells that use the same effect.
- Talisman of the Stalwart scrolls can now be scribed by druids.
- The combat proc granted by Arcane Arietta will now cause additional damage for bards based on their wind instrument mods. This only effects the procs for the bard herself, and not the rest of the group.
- The endurance cost for Calanin's Synergy has been increased to 385/439/468 up from 308/351/374. The duration in the effect has been increased by 6 seconds.
- The Twincast Self Buff spells are no longer focused by duration extension focuses.

*** Tradeskills ***

- Fixed a bug with the Pure sealed power-sources made via tradeskills. They were opening one tier behind where they should (so the Tier 1 took Tier 2 raid to open.) They should now open properly with the proper tier of content.
- Fixed an issue with Dull, Murky and Foggy Sealed Energeian Orbs that could prevent them from opening properly.
- The following spells created by spell research now create a duplicate scroll instead of the original scroll. The original scrolls are now no trade. This does mean that you may have a no trade version currently, unfortunately there is no reasonable solution for a refund that is not able to allow players to create infinite scrolls. This change is intended to prevent players from creating infinite scrolls for free. Skill: Champion's Aura, Skill: Poison Spikes Trap, Skill: Master's Aura, Skill: Bloodlust Aura, Spell: Blessed Aura, Spell: Decrepit Skin, Spell: Aura of the Muse, Spell: Elddar's Grasp, Spell: Puratus, Spell: Moonshadow, Spell: Ghost of Renewal, Spell: Mind Shatter, Spell: Chaos Flame, Spell: Iceflame Guard, Spell: Mind Flay, and Spell: Spirit of Oroshar.
- The research spell Odium can now be researched by priests as intended.

*** NPCs ***

- Dragorn Muramites should be providing a normal amount of experience again.
- Fenden Helter has decided to mark down many of his items.
- Additional items have been added to Fenden Helter in Dragonscale and are available for purchase.

*** AA ***

- Modified how the AAs Animation Empathy and Advanced Pet Discipline function to support the new Pet changes to the User Interface and Pet controls.
- Replaced the Skill Cap adjustments on Third Spire of Ancestors and Third Spire of the Savage Lord with a bonus to minimum damage to avoid certain stacking conflicts.
- Adjusted the stacking order on Rogue's Fury to better stack with various Rogue disciplines, including Deadeye and Deadly Precision.

*** Miscellaneous ***

- Made various zone stability improvements.

*** UI: General ***

- Enhanced the Raid Window. (See UI: Enhanced Raid Window)
- The Pet Window has received a revamp! (See UI: Pet Window Improvements)
- Added chat window text output for users being invited to raids even when the raid confirmation popup is turned on.
- Added a button in the options general tab that toggles display of pet owner names on pets.

- You should no longer be spammed with focus effect messages when you have an active mercenary .
- For custom UI creators, ListboxColumns can now have their own tooltips instead of just the Listbox.

*** UI: Enhanced Raid Window ***

- Updated the raid management window to allow for sorting and expedition / shared task management improvements. Also added AFK, dead, and out of zone status.
- Created the /comparetaskraid (Shared Task - Raid) and /compareexpedraid (Expedition - Raid) commands to list the players that are not in both lists.
- Updated the expedition window to allow for simplified raid and shared task invitations.
- Updated the shared task window to allow for simplified raid and expedition invitations.
- The group numbers in the raid window are now color coded in order to better differentiate between groups when sorting by group.
- Column headers now each have their own tool tip.

*** UI: Pet Window Improvements ***

- You can now assign buttons to all pet commands in the pet window.
- Pet target will be displayed under your pets hp bar so you will always know who your pet is attacking.
- Added toggleable buttons throughout the pet UI for sit/stand, follow/guard, focus, hold, taunt, and spell hold.
- Added new pet text based commands. You will now be able to toggle all states off or on, or simply toggle the state with a pet text based command. For example, /pet focus on, /pet focus off, and /pet focus.
- Added a new pet attack command to switch your pet to attack the new target regardless of AA's or level; great for new and low level players. The old command will still exist as qattack.
- Added a pet hold functionality.
- New pet focus + pet hold functionality (call this pet state "pet convergence" ). Now, when you turn on both the focus and hold states, your pet will attack SPECIFICALLY what you want it to and when finished won't attack or aggro or do anything else.
- Improved /pet back off. Fully clears the hate list and stops your pet from doing whatever it was doing before.
- Pet follow is now on by default when entering zones.
- Added the pet owner's name below the pet name text (i.e., "Soandso's pet").
- When right clicking a pet button, commands not available to you are filtered out.
- Added messages your pet will say when issued different commands to clarify the intended behavior.
- The state of all pet buttons are now persisted across zoning and logging (except sit and follow that default to their appropriate settings when zoning).

There was some emergency server downtime earlier today. Also included was this hotfix (from the patcher):

*** Highlights ***

- Pet hold can now be used with charmed pets again (as long as the owner has the AA).
- Put separators back into raid window. Separators will now appear between sorting groups for all sorting criteria except for "by name."

*** Quests & Events ***

- Added a check to make sure there are miscreants in Shadow Haven when they are supposed to be there.
- Bristlebane's party will now show up in, er, minitab as expected.
- Added a default "Hail" dialog to each kill target in the Justice of the Tribunal 10th Anniversary task that will let you re-engage if you already hailed that NPC but failed to kill him.

*** NPC ***

- Modified the spawn rates of several NPCs in Fabled PoP that drop the "Swarm Pet" Weapons to normalize the rate that they appear. Most spawn rates were increased but some were reduced that were appearing too frequently.

*** Tradeskills ***

- Fixed the broken coffin poison bottle. Now it can make any NORMAL poison combine as well as the original coffin bottle combines.
- The following spell research recipes now create a duplicate (tradable) scroll instead of the original (no-drop) scroll. For real this time! Skill: Champion's Aura, Skill: Poison Spikes Trap, Skill: Master's Aura, Skill: Bloodlust Aura, Spell: Blessed Aura, Spell: Decrepit Skin, Spell: Aura of the Muse, Spell: Elddar's Grasp, Spell: Puratus, Spell: Moonshadow, Spell: Ghost of Renewal, Spell: Mind Shatter, Spell: Chaos Flame, Spell: Iceflame Guard, Spell: Mind Flay, and Spell: Spirit of Oroshar.

*** Pets ***
- Pet hold can now be used with charmed pets again (as long as the owner has the AA).
- Now only PC pets will display their owner's name under them.
- Telling your pet to attack another target when focus is turned on will now cause it to switch targets and focus exclusively on the new target.
- Fixed a bug where telling your pet to attack a new target when focus is turned on would fail if the pet hated the new target the most already (even if the new target was not already its target).
- Casting swarm pets or familiars should no longer disrupt the state of the buttons on your pet window when you already have a normal pet up.
- Pet target hit points are now updated even if you are not targeting the pet's target.
- Fixed several other bugs that were causing the buttons in the pet window to become out of sync with the server or to reset upon zoning.
- Qattack will now only change the pet's target if the pet did not already have a target. This is contrasted with the regular attack command which will force the pet to change targets (if focused or not). Qattack now simply adds the target NPC to the pet's hate list, so that it will attack that target at a later time when its other targets are dead.

*** UI ***

- Put separators back into raid window. Separators will now appear between sorting groups for all sorting criteria except for "by name."
- When sorting by group, empty slots should always be shown after filled slots for each group. Also group leaders should always be at the top of each group.
- When sorting by anything but group, all the empty slots are removed and not displayed.

- Changed -

SIDL.xml

*** Previously Updated ***
- Fixed a problem with Atler Flamejabber. He should now reappear in his correct location after someone has completed his quest.
- Nettle Higglesbury should now correctly gather some rabble rousers around him once he's finished his pie.
- Fixed an issue with Bristlebane's parties not showing up as expected after 20 hours.

*** Zones ***

- Guild Banner summoning has been turned on for Solteris (note that all usual restrictions apply).

*** Pets ***

- Guard and follow are on separate buttons again. Guard and follow states are independent of stop and sit. Stop and sit are overrides for guard and follow. Pressing guard or follow when stop or sit are engaged will automatically turn them off.

- Changed the behavior of the stop command. It is now a toggle-able state. When activated, your pet will stand still and stop attacking, but remember who it hates. Stop can be turned off manually, or is automatically turned off whenever follow, guard, attack, qattack, or back off are used.

- Added the greater hold state (ghold). Greater hold is granted by pet discipline. It works very much like regular hold except that regular hold allows opponents to be added to the pet's hate list when the pet already has opponents on its list. Greater hold only allows NPCs you specifically add via attack or qattack to be added to its hate list. Hold and ghold are mutually exclusive.

- Pet help has been updated with the new information about these changes.

*** Miscellaneous ***

- Fixed a crash with certain custom UIs with custom hot bars.

- Fixed a problem that caused the quest level ranges for quest givers to not be displayed under their name.

- Lockout timers can once again be sorted in the expedition window.

*** UI ***

- Optimized the raid window to get rid of the long pause when opening it when there are a large number of people in the raid.

*** Previously Hotfixed ***

- Ierene Seldon now spawns in her correct location in the Blue Hawk's Tavern.

- Tober Grandim in Blightfire Moors will no longer agro on players.

- The Manaetic Behemoth should once again appear in the Plane of Innovation.

- Nettle Higglesbury should now correctly gather some rabble rousers around him once he's finished his pie.

- Fixed a problem with Atler Flamejabber. He should now reappear in his correct location after someone has completed his quest.

Here are the patch notes from this morning's patch:

*** Highlights ***

- After reviewing the difficulty curve of the Dragons players fight in the "Dragons, Dragons, Dragons" raid we determined that it made more sense for players to fight the mighty Dragon Vishimtar *after* the dragons of Relic, rather than before. The event has been modified to reflect this.

*** Items ***

- Paladin leg armor from SoF has had detrimental spell haste added to it.

- Haste has been added to caster and priest belts from SoF and SoD that did not have it before.

- Updated the vendor purchased Archaic bard equipment to have mods equivalent to the dropped Versions.

- All fabled items created for 2009 now have a required level of 75 and a recommended level of 79.

- Added a cap to the effectiveness of the following charms: Bundle of Tiger Whiskers, Carved Fox Ear, Sapphire Spiroc Feather, Mammoth Tusk Powder, Intricate Defiant Charm, and Intricate Consigned Charm.

*** Quests & Events ***

- After reviewing the difficulty curve of the Dragons players fight in the "Dragons, Dragons, Dragons" raid we determined that it made more sense for players to fight the mighty Dragon Vishimtar *after* the dragons of Relic, rather than before. The event has been modified to reflect this.

- Corrected some issues with the teleportation script for the Dragons, Dragons, Dragons raid in PoK. You should now be able to correctly teleport to all zones linked to this task from PoK (it was previously working from inside the instances but not always working in PoK).

- The expansion requirement for the "Dragons, Dragons, Dragons" event has been removed.

- The Anniversary Scavenger Hunt events were not updated to end at the same time as the other Fabled events. This has been corrected and they will all follow the same schedule in the future.

*** Previously Updated ***

- Reduced the area that the Militia Enforcers will check for scoundrels working for the Poison Masters in Freeport.

Here is today's patch message (from the patcher):

*** Highlights ***

- EQ’s 10th Anniversary celebrations continues. All the raid events will remain until May 25th. Lower Guk and Unrest group encounters kicked off on the 11th and end on the 25th as well. Enjoy the rest of the celebrations!

*** Items ***

- Added a missing heal focus to the Protective Gorget of the Deep.
- Added Improved Parry/Block to several neck items that were missing it.
- Applied new icons to the Beastlord epic 1.0 (Claws of the Savage Spirit).
- Changed the displayed solvent on many destroyable augments to make it clear that they can be dissolved by the Augmentation Solvent.
- Irae Faycite Shard: Ethereal Enhancement, Irae Faycite Shard: Klixcxyk's and Icesheet Casc., Irae Faycite Shard: Ethereal Burn and Irae Faycite Shard: Inizen's and Glacial Collapse should now properly focus the intended spells. A change has been made to all similar foci that should prevent a similar problem in the future.

*** Spells ***

- Triggered PC spells with large dummy values in cast time have had that time reduced or removed.

*** AAs ***

- The Berserker AAs Blur of Axes and Precision of Axes have been increased in power.
- The Shadow Knight AA "Cascading Theft of Life" has been renamed "Cascading Theft of Defense" to better fit its function.
- Harmonious arrow now correctly assigns hate to its user.

*** Raids ***

- Added Fractured Coeval Luminessence and Fractured Coeval Incandessence as a chance to drop from the chest that the mini bosses in discord tower drop. This also reduces the chance for stat and weapon augments from this chest.

*** Tradeskills ***

- The first set of changes to poison have been made. Strike of Ssraeshza poisons have a 10 second recast on them. Bite of the Shissar, Strike of the Shissar, Solusek's Burn and E'ci's Lament Poison remove about half the hate they give on each strike. Quellious' Trauma removes about half the hate it did before. Quellious' Trauma, Myrmidon's Sloth, Messenger's Bane, Fighter's Bane, Warlord's Bane, Archer's Bane and Monk's Bane have had their "proc count" increased so they last longer.
- Messenger's Bane poisons will properly snare their target rather than giving them a speed boost.
- The recipe for Thundering Blades Rk. II has been disabled. It should not yet be able to be created.

*** Pets ***

- Fixed some typos in the pet help window.
- Fixed some problems with hot-keyed commands not displaying their state correctly.
- A new "regroup" command has been added. This command is very similar to "stop" except when using "regroup" the pet will not only stop attacking, but will revert to either follow or guard depending on what is selected. This essentially mimics the old "hold" behavior. "Regroup" and "stop" are mutually exclusive. If you use "regroup" both sit and stop should turn off. If you use "stop" then "regroup" should turn off.

*** Miscellaneous ***

- Campfire summoning has been turned on for the following zones (note that all usual restrictions apply): Crystallos, Mansion, Qinimi, and Tipt.
- Guild Banner summoning has been turned on for the following zones (note that all usual restrictions apply): Uqua, Tacvi, Qinimi, Tipt, Anguish, Demiplane of Blood, Deathknell - Tower of Dissonance, Crystallos (both normal and raid), Mansion (both normal and raid), Discord Raid and Discord Tower Raid.
- Fixed a problem that was causing voice chat volume sliders to get stuck on the screen.
- Revamped the way guild information is stored on the server to get around limitations on the maximum number of guilds. Some servers were hitting the max.
- Fixed a problem with raid dumps that were made when the raid window was not visible.
- The voice chat bar is now visible on login if your voice chat is active.
- Fixed a problem with bard focuses that caused Singing and Instrument mastery to not work if the song was otherwise not focused by any item or effect.
- Fixed a problem with guild creation that was causing it to fail when you tried to create a guild with a name whose beginning was a subset of an existing guild (e.g. creating "Killer" when "Killers in the Mist" already existed).
- Fixed an issue with displayed ordering of marketplace items.
