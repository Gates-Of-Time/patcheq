Here is the "sneak peek" version (subject to change) of Wednesday's patch notes, as found on the patcher:

*** Highlights ***

- The Convorteum and the First Creation:

The Convorteum is a secluded area of the Underfoot that is the home of the First Creation and the heart of the conspiracy against Brell.  It is a massive, inverted pyramidal structure sprouting from the ceiling of a huge, lava-filled chamber. Those that have been converted to the Faith of Self come to the Convorteum at times to show their loyalty to the First Creation and to show that they accept the tenets of the Faith of Self - place oneself above all others. This creates confusion in the minds of some, mixed messages that have lead to much sadness, loss and even madness.

The First Creation was the first and most loyal creation of Brell Serilis, and the very first sentient form he ever created. The First Creation chose to rebel against Brell. His tampering with the design of new races is subtle but in powerful ways, causing them to turn along paths that lead to destruction and harm to the Underfoot.

The First has done something to distract Brell, to turn his attention away from the Underfoot.  Brell's loyal servants are not usually ones to question his actions or decisions, and few of them have even tried to discover what is wrong, or even understand that anything is wrong.  But a few have, and the intrusion of upworlders gives the loyalists more options, more tools, to further their understanding of the problems in Underfoot.

- Many of the rare creatures in Underfoot have been moved to consolidate their spawn locations.  Be on the lookout for new places to find them.

- Most Underfoot raids have had significant tuning changes made in order to make them more surmountable.  Please see the "Quests and Events" section for details.

- There is a new stats pane on the inventory panel that displays many stats not aggregated elsewhere.

*** Items ***

- The focus on the Ranger Breastplate has changed to Focused Storm of Arrows Fury which increases damage from Focused Storm of Arrows.  The amount is equivalent to the increase in damage other damage increasing breastplates get over existing foci.
- The Underfoot berserker breastplate effects should now stack with Shared Bloodlust.
- Changed the augment slot on the Magmatic Deflector from type 4 to type 7.
- Added an augment slot to the Eyepiece of the Fancy Tinker.

*** Tradeskills ***

- Three more ranks of the Salvage Alternate Ability have been created.  Each rank offers an additional 5% of salvage ability.  You must own the Underfoot expansion in order to purchase these new ranks.
- Added bag tokens for the new tradeskilled ornaments.
- Added Faerune to Cosgrove Arcanist Seals and Cosgrove head seals, as long as they did not already have a worn focus.
- Tradeskill Treasurer NPCs will always give molds to dwarves, even if they are asked for patterns.  They will no longer offer a quest for armor patterns.  Any Dwarven books turned in as patterns are unavailable for now, but are not lost.  We will continue to work on a better solution.
- Increased the direct damage of the Tallon and Vallon tactic poisons by an additional 50%.  This portion can hit for critical damage.  Doubled the synchronous damage done by these poisons.  This portion will not hit for critical damage.  The duration of the debuff has been increased to 12 ticks.
  
*** Quests & Events ***

- Fippy the Destroyer's power up damage and frequency has been reduced.
- Reduced the damage on Fippy the Destroyer's Shadow Strike ability.
- Add numbers have been reduced in all phases of Fippy the Destroyer's event, except between the first and second phases.
- Reduced combat values on all non-unique Burynai in the Masked Invaders event.
- All Burynai in the Masked Invaders event should be a bit more manageable in general.
- Slightly increased the time between power-ups for the Brutale in the Masked Invaders event.

- Reduced damage output from the bosses in Grunkuck's event.
- Increased the interval between add spawns in Grunkuck's event.
- Grunkuck's mate will now spawn near Grunkuck in order to help keep her safe.
- Brath's damage when his regeneration ability is removed has been slightly reduced.
- The Arcane Shards of Brath will not immediately split if the one they hate the most is too far away.  You now have 15 seconds to engage them before they get angry and split in two.
- The Icy Shards of Brath will now correctly reset the Strike of Brell timer when they are hit by six cold spells.
- Reduced the number of 'food' aphids in the Guardians of the Hive event from 15 to 10.
- Increased the time between possible aphid wave spawns in the Guardians of the Hive event.
- Slightly reduced the HP of each of the boss Klik'nar in the Guardians of the Hive event.
- Increased the time before the healing mushrooms cast their spells in the Guardians of the Hive event.
- Fixed a bug with the young queens in the Cliknar Queen event.  They had taken on too many of their progenitor's powers due to overenthusiastic genetic material.  They have returned to their proper status.
- Corrected combat settings for the Death Beetle event.
- The Living Legacy event rewards for 2010 and later will no longer be dependent on your server's best score.  Any event completion from this point forward will be able to grant its reward immediately.  You still will receive the best augment if your 2008 or 2009 scores were better.
- Added some in-mission reward chests to Underfoot missions in Cooling Chamber, Brell's Rest, Underquarry, Foundation, Pellucid Grotto, Arthicrex and Shining City.  Rewards for the other missions are forthcoming in the next update.
- The Shade of Darott will no longer immediately send you out of his mission if you accidentally hail him twice.

*** Spells ***

- Beastlord - Steeltrap Jaws, Lockfang Jaws, and Fellgrip Jaws have been reworked to only be limited by their own triggered effects and not other spells cast by the pet.

- Fixed a bug in spells that vary with distance that was causing incorrect values when damage was reduced to 0.
           
*** NPC ***

- Many of the rare creatures in Underfoot have been moved to consolidate their spawn locations. Be on the lookout for new places to find them.

*** Mercenaries ***

- Mercenaries can now be maintained with Bayle Marks (an alternate currency).  These can be purchased on the marketplace as an alternate payment method to platinum.  Platinum is still accepted by all mercenaries, but Bayle Marks will be consumed first if they are available.

- Fixed several grammar issues in Underquarry, Foundation, and Lichen Creep.
- Fixed several resource leaks.
- Fixed a thread-safety issue with non-"original" graphics memory modes.  If you are running in "original" mode, you will be automatically switched back to "most memory" mode.  The eventual goal is to remove the need for "original' mode. You can still switch it back to "original" if you encounter problems (please post about any issues you have).  NOTE:  This has nothing to do with "West bug" like symptoms in Field of Scale, etc.  That's a totally separate issue.  This may address the problems reported with corrupted textures when the memory optimized modes were introduced.
- Fixed a problem with twinheal when triggered from an item.  It now does the twin-heal and consumes the twinheal charge.  Previously the charge was consumed but no twinheal occurred.

    Damascite Encrusted Cephalic Clay will now properly combine to make Damascite head armor.
    Increased the HP, Mana and Endurance on Tier 9 weapons where they were too low.
    Most stats and mods on Damascite armor were not set correctly.  This has been corrected.
    All Underfoot weapon procs have been modified to make them more consistent and to ensure they function correctly with Twinproc and Twincast.  In most cases effectiveness was increased, but there are instances where proc damage was lowered to allow weapons to fit better within their tier.  This process will be repeated with more recent weapon procs as time allows.
    Added a type 7 augment slot to the Sootstained Shroud of Creation.
    Added standard click effects to the later versions of the new prayer shawls.
    Fixed the incorrect cast proc on Revered Fighting Courage of Brell, Revered Casting Ease of Brell, Sacred Fighting Courage of Brell and Sacred Casting Ease of Brell.

    Modified the rune part of the tank version of the Blessed and Sacred Serilis Prayer Shawl.
    Updated the heal amount on Brell's Blessed Aloe Balm and Brell's Sacred Aloe Balm and moved both to the short duration buff window.
    The Casting Ease of Brell, Healing Force of Brell and Chromatic Force of Brell shawl effects should no longer be triggered by AAs.
    Added bard instrument modifiers and other spell foci to Underfoot armor pieces that were missing them.
    Fixed a bug with Knowledge of the Past 6, 7, & 8 that capped the HP/Mana regen at the Rank 5 level.
    Fixed a bug with Soothing Breath 3, 4, & 5 that capped the HP/Mana regen at a lower level.
    Changed the click effect on Vermilionite Underbead to Knowledge of the Past III.
    Some of the group augments for the 11th Anniversary Mission have had their statistics improved.

    Corrected an issue causing the Stealing my Life Back mission to interfere with The First Corruption mission.
    The Cooling Chamber mission "Tasnise Underbelly" has had some of its population removed.  Slightly reduced the damage done by Tasnise and his undead mini bosses.
    Tasnise Underbelly will now send the entire group down into the icy depths of the Cooling Chamber when he gets angry at the intrusion.
    Ugen should correctly speak his dialog when you give multiple items to him at once in The Silent Schism mission.
    All Underfoot quests will now award coin upon completion.
