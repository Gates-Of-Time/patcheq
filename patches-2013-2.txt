(Note: Servers are expected to come back up at around 10:00 A.M. Pacific Time.)

    *** Highlights ***

    - EverQuest's 20th expansion, Call of the Forsaken, has launched!  A cataclysm has befallen the Western Plains of Karana, where a great dragon calling herself Lady Lendiniara has appeared.  Is she here to help the people of Norrath, or to destroy them?  What connection does this event have to Zebuxoruk, the mad immortal who was forsaken by the gods? Will you be the first to discover the truth in this ongoing saga?

    - Fixed an bug where Trap Circumvention was not properly applying the chance to not trigger a trap.

    - A number of existing achievements have been modified:
    - - The achievements for completing all of the raids in an expansion are now called "Conqueror" achievements rather than "Vanquisher" achievements.
    - - The achievements for completing all of the raid challenges in an expansion are now called "Vanquisher" achievements rather than "Conqueror" achievements.
    - - New achievements have been created for completing all of the raid challenges in a particular raid. These are referred to as "Vanquisher of Raidname" achievements.
    - - The ability to purchase the rare items from Rain of Fear raids from currency merchants is now tied to individual raid "Vanquisher" achievements rather than the achievements for completing all of the raid challenges in the expansion.

    - For multi-part expansions like the Rain of Fear, Shadow of Fear, Heart of Fear trilogy, over-arching achievements have been better broken up to reflect individual completion of each release.
    - Several over-arching achievements from the Rain of Fear expansion have had optional elements from the Shadow of Fear and Heart of Fear removed and have been renamed.
    - - The completion date for those achievements should not have changed, but their name has. For example, the achievement previously titled "Explorer of Rain of Fear" is now called "Lesser Explorer of Rain of Fear" but will still show the date you completed it under its previous title.

    - - This is an alternate means for group level players to obtain this item. Raid level players that have completed both this achievement and the achievement "Vanquisher of the Heart of Fear" will not gain any benefit from this duplicate reward set. This is intended.

    - Modified the achievement "Hunter of Chelsith Reborn" to make "The Undefeated Blade" and "A Huge Mistake" optional encounters for the achievement's completion.

    - The achievements "Adept Hunter of the Void", "Veteran Hunter of the Void" and "Expert Hunter of the Void" have had their components changed to better reflect an increase in difficulty from one tier to another.

    - Added "/target group #" to allow for targeting a group member.  This behaves just like pressing F1 - F6.

    - Corrected an issue where buy lines could be setup for multiple items without having the proper monetary compensation on hand.
    - The treasure chest ground spawn in South Ro now looks like a treasure chest instead of a bag.  How did it fit into that tiny bag, anyway?
