We will be opening up a new section on the EverQuest website solely dedicated to the Test Server. Once the Test Server section is available, changes and bug fixes made to the Test Server will be documented, so that you may help us test the changes.
As for server updates, from this day forward, we will be updating the regular EverQuest servers every Tuesday morning at 3:00am Pacific Standard Time.

We will be performing a patch and server update at 3:00am Pacific Standard Time on Tuesday, April 6th. The patch contains the following additions and fixes;

1. Crashing while giving newbie items to NPCs.
2. Going link-dead would cause the character to regenerate extremely quickly.
3. Various sound related crashes were fixed.
4. Created items disappearing from characters after zoning.
5. Characters able to use skills, which are not allowed for their specific class.
6. A limit to the successful hit and spell messages has been implemented that should reduce the number of unneeded messages sent to the players.
7. After slaying a creature, the player will receive a proper faction hit.
8. Occasionally, after being disconnected, users would crash upon re-logging into the server.
9. The DLS sound system is now enabled.
10. A new text command, "/reply " has been implemented. This will allow players to reply to the last character that sent a private tell message.
11. Many adjustments to the faction system were made.
12. Multiple quest-related bugs were fixed.
13. A slew of quests were added.
14. A number of new music tracks were added to various zones.
15. Occasionally, sound settings would reset to default, while graphically, the slider bars appeared to be correct.
16. Various safe zones were eliminated to prevent exploitation.
17. Some equipped weapons and items would draw into the user interface overlays, which would result in the client crashing.
18. It was possible to strafe at normal speed while rooted or sneaking.

Music works on all sound cards. If you still aren't getting music, 
double check to make sure that music is turned on in-game. In addition, 
you may not have correct drivers, and/or you may not have it set 
properly. In any case, either call our tech support or go to the tech 
support area in chat. Please be advised that music DOES have a 
performance impact on the game, although it is a small one.

Frame Rate Speedup - Our resident graphics genius sped up the game a 
fair amount. Those of you in areas like Greater Faydark should see some 
real improvements.

Corpse Bug - We've been tracking a nasty little bug that would make 
corpses disappear. I'm sure many of you know firsthand about this one. 
We finally nailed it and it should be safe to die again ;)

There's a whole bunch of other stuff that has been fixed as well and is 
listed in the patch message.

Just as an FYI we did find a server-side bug that's been fixed and we 
will probably have to down the servers one at a time to update since 
this bug is one that really needs to be fixed.

One final Item: Yes, glide on banshee's is coming back. It should be in 
later this week.

------------------------------
1) Two server side zone related crashes have been resolved.

2) A bug with the charm spell which caused players to be killed.

The server update last night went flawlessly, and has appeared to resolve a zone crash problem which was occurring. Our next server update is scheduled to take place on Tuesday, April 20th at midnight Pacific Daylight Time. An updated list of changes and bug fixes will be posted on the EverQuest news section on the login server.

UUnet has informed us that they will be performing an upgrade to their San Diego router at 3:00am on April 20th.

Hello All,

I waited until it was 7:30pm pst tonight to write this update. I wanted to make sure things were stable before I wrote this. Lately every time I give an update something bad happened right after I sent it.

Here's a summary of what was done in the last 2 days

1) We did a major hardware upgrade to our primary router here in San 
Diego.
2) We worked with CERFnet to do a router upgrade to their facility here 
in San Diego.
3) We moved Karana over to CERFnet
4) We brought up Rodcet Nife

I think you will find now that the packet loss should be basically 
gone... at least on our end. We were definetely causing some of the 
loss before (only when we hit major numbers) but now things are very, 
very clean running and that is with 23,582 people on just as I write 
this (a new record).

Does this mean that EVERYONE'S Packet Loss is gone? Absolutely not. 
BUT, I did some surveys in most of the worlds and about 750f the people 
told me their Packet Loss was great. If you are having problems now, do 
a traceroute to chat.everquest.com and send it to the email address 
traceroute@verant.com and we will take a look. We take our customers 
connections very seriously, and if a whole lot of people on one network 
are having a problem we will do our best to look into it. It doesn't 
mean we can always get the reaction we want (some networks are just 
plain bad) but many times we can help find a legitimate problem and 
help correct it.

Some of you may also not realize what the network statistics we have in game actually are for:

The left hand number is your ping to the server in milliseconds.

The left-middle number (percentage) is your packet loss to the server.
The right-middle number (percentage) is your packet loss from the server.
The right hand number is the data rate. THIS IS NOT THE PING. - I love hearing about the "terrible" pings in game of 3000.
It is my strong belief (forgive me for this rant) that EVERY online game should have this type of meter so that you are getting real feedback about the network status.

John Smedley

Thanks!

Citizens of Norrath,

We are pleased to announce that the hardware upgrade that was performed on our router this morning has appeared to resolve the severe packet loss problems that many players were encountering over the past week. We have been, and will continue to monitor the load on the new hardware to assure that the packet-loss problems will no longer occur on our end. During the router upgrade we transported the Karana server farm to the AT&T CerfNet facility to further reduce the load on our router. Also, the new "Rodcet Nife" server was just brought up to accommodate the additional users that have joined over the past few weeks.

After thoroughly testing changes made only for Rallos Zek (PK server), we have activated the new code for the PK server ONLY. The changes include the following;

1) Pets will no longer kill themselves if their master has invisibility cast on them.
2) Pets will no longer attack other players while they are in guard mode if their master goes link-dead.
3) Pets will now attack opposing combatants while their master is dueling.
4) NPCs will no longer respond to invisible PCs.

Other fixes and changes include:

1) The corpse class tag will not be listed as "Unknown".
2) Players will be given text messages for items that they cannot obtain while looting a corpse, instead of the item disappearing.
3) A number of quests and combat related exploits were fixed.
4) Characters are no longer able to use the disarm command while using feign death.

At Midnight, on Wednesday the 28th, the servers will be brought down for an update.

April 29th, 4:00pm

As posted yesterday, we will be bringing down all of the servers at midnight tonight PDT, for a server-side update. Our estimated downtime is should be less than two hours. The fixes/changes are listed below.

1) Traveling by boat should be much more stable.
2) A few various zone crashes.
3) The corpse class tag will not be listed as "Unknown".
4) Players will be given text messages for items that they cannot obtain while looting a corpse, instead of the item disappearing.
5) A number of quests and combat related exploits were fixed.
6) Characters are no longer able to use the disarm command while using feign death.

We will also be putting up a new client patch on Monday at Midnight as well. A list of the client-side changes will be posted on Monday morning.

May 3rd, 5:00pm
------------------------------

We will be patching a new version of the EverQuest client executable tonight at Midnight PDT. One of the significant additions is the option to utilize auto mip-mapping in Glide mode. Mip-mapping may be activated in the Display menu, located within the Options directory. In addition, we have made numerous bug fixes and game play adjustments, of which are listed below.

1) If you have participated in a fight against an NPC, you will take a faction hit.
2) Players may no longer disarm an NPC that has a magical weapon armed.
3) Safe-fall is now working as intended, however, damage from falling is required to advance in the skill.
4) Players should not see other characters "popping" around while riding the boats.
5) Trades will properly cancel out when the characters involved walk away.
6) The Friend's List is now functioning as intended.
7) A few crash bugs related to failed font calls have been resolved.
8) Creature and Player corpses should no longer draw into the overlays.
9) Vampiric Embrace has been modified from it's original design to improve game play.
10) A number of quest were implemented.

Included in tonight's update is a major enhancement to the populations of both Solusek's Eye and Mistmoore.

Tomorrow night, a revised version of the EverQuest Manual will be patched. The revision will include a new section which outlines the spells and skills that have been modified from their original design to enhance game play.

The login difficulties that you may have been encountering over the past 1.5 hours have been resolved. We were able to pinpoint and fix
a major bug which has been plaguing the login procedure for quite some time. Now that this problem has been addressed, the login
process should be carried out much more swiftly. We apologize for the inaccessibility of the EverQuest servers for this short time,
however, this fix should insure future stability.

We have included a revised version of the EverQuest Manual in this patch which includes an amendment to various skills, spells and other game play releated features. The section briefly outlines the modification, introduction, and removal of various features found in EverQuest. This information may also be found at www.everquest.com in the "In Development" section located in "Features". Both of these will be updated on a regular basis.

General Changes

- Scrolls are no longer lore items - this means that you can have more than one.
- Research components were made more accessible on higher level mobs
- Several items will now appear as "Pending Lore" and will become "Lore" in a subsequent update. The servers will only allow ONE 'Lore' item in a character's inventory (that includes the bank) - please make note of any items you own that are 'Pending Lore' - it is YOUR responsibility to have those items sold or traded by the time (approximately one week) we change them to 'Lore.' We will not be responsible for items lost when this change is made.

Zone Enhancements

- Additional treasure has been added to Permafrost Keep, and some of the items already there have been enhanced - now is the time to plan that Permafrost excursion!
- The bandits of West Karana are increasing their presence! You'll find more bandit camps there, as well as bandits traveling between those camps and elsewhere.
- The spawn rates in many outdoor areas has been increased - this should make it easier to find things to kill.

Bug fixes and newly implemented features

- A number of quests were fixed as well as implemented.
- A Bad language filter has been implemented. Typing "/filter" will toggle it on and off.
- Pets that have been commanded to sit will no longer to appear to stand up while they are supposed to be seated.
- While in the full screen view, users may now toggle the translucent overlay backgrounds on and off by pressing the "~" key.
- Players may now loot corpses in shallow water or lava by typing "/loot" while the corpse is targeted.
- We have implemented an Auto-follow command. To auto-follow another player, target the character, then type "/follow". You must be grouped with the character in order to successfully carry out the command.
- A Role Playing switched has been added so that players may identify other characters who wish to make known they are Role Playing. To activate the Role Playing switch, target your character and type "/roleplay", if the character is +PvP, the name tag above their head will appear as a darker shade of Red, whereas a non-PvP players name will appear purple.
- If the user drops a backpack containing spells on the ground, the spells will no longer disappear.

- Eye of Zomm will no longer work in conjunction with pets - you can now have one or the other. Sorry.
- Wave of Enfeeblement (now Vampiric Curse) and Circle of Death (both Necromancer) will not work for the next week or so while we make a fix on them.

Trade Skill Changes

Jewel Craft - All of the jewelry has had increased magical properties (pre-existing jewelry items remain unchanged).
Fletching - When fletching arrows, they will be produced in sets of 5, instead of 1.
Baking, Blacksmithing, Brewing, and Pottery have been changed to either return items on failure and be able to produce multiple items and quantities on success.
Example:
Baking muffins, success means the player will receive three muffins and retaining the muffin tin, however, when unsuccessful, the player will still get the muffin tin back and lose all other components. Another example would be if a player wishes to sharpen a rusty short sword. If the player succeeds, they will receive a tarnished short sword, however, failure will result in retaining the rusty weapon but losing the sharpening stone.

June 27th, 1999

Due to the situation which occurred on the CerfNet servers on Tuesday and Thursday night, we have had to place most of our resources towards rectifying the problem on the live servers. However, we were able to make a few various changes to the Test server, some of which will be propagated to the live servers on Monday. The features and bug fixes are listed below.
- Currently, when a character dies, they return with 25% of their Mana and Health, in addition, they have a massive hit to their stats. - This will NOT remain true, and we will be removing it next week.

- Nagafen's Lair and Permafrost have been revamped with new treasure, items, etc. In addition, changes have been made to NPC spawning to the them.

- A number of fixes were made to Research.

The following fixes have been made to spells.

Vampiric Curse / Bond of Death (formerly Circle of Death) now work with their new effects

Fufil's Curtailing Chant (BARD) now works on monsters

Hungry Earth (Necromancer) is now researchable - check your book

The Test Server will be down between the hours of 6pm and 6am PDT for internal testing purposes. This schedule for the Test Server will only occur for approximately 1 week, after that the Test Server will remain on-line 24 hours a day.

UUnet will be performing maintenance at 3:00 AM, on July the 13th, which will result in players losing connection to the servers. Since this maintenance will be taking place, we have moved our regularly scheduled update time from 7:00am to 3:00am for tomorrow only. UUnet has given us an approximate downtime of 3 hours. A list of game play enhancements is listed below.

Root spells will now overwrite spells with both positive and negative movement components in a more consistent pattern.

Banish Undead and Banish Summoned (LVL 49 CLERIC, NECROMANCER, MAGICIAN, DRUID, etc.) have been changed from All or Nothing saving throws to a regular saving throws. This will make them easier to use against high level creatures.

Magician summoning spells that produce multiple items have been changed to summon more items as the Magician's level increases.

All Poison and Disease DOT spells have received tuning.

Druid DOT's (stinging swarm series) has been adjusted to do more damage over a shorter period of time.

Immolate (DRUID) now does more damage, but has a shorter duration.

Mesmerization (ENCHANTER) has been changed to a straight AOE radius spell - it will no longer hang in the area. The AOE radius has been increased, as has the range.

Ice (LVL 49 DRUID) has been changed from an AOE spell to a single target DD spell.

Rage (SHAMAN) has been upgraded to a LVL 49 spell - Fury remains level 34.

Invisibility spells (Invisibility, Gather Shadows, Camouflage, etc.) will now blink before they wears off.

Hitting F1 twice, or /pet target will now target your pet.The Duration on Pack Regeneration (DRUID) has been increased.

Shield of Lava (MAGICIAN) has had its mana cost reduced.

The Research entries for Intensify Death and Hungry Earth (NECROMANCER) have been updated.

New high level Necromancer spells have been added to vendors.

A new Wizard spell Chill Sight has been added to the Wizard vendors.

The Magician's Summon Heatstone and Summon Coldstone spells will now work as long as the Stone is held or worn (the spell effect will never wear off).

The Insight spell (ENCHANTER) now adds Wisdom, not Intelligence. Brilliance still adds Intelligence.

The Tashan series (ENCHANTER) has had the recasting time reduced.

Research for higher level spells has been made a bit easier.

Spells that Add HP now work better on pets.

The Necromancer's replacement spell for Charm (Screaming Terror) is on the vendors. Play with this spell - it is different from any other spell of this type that you have ever seen.

Shrink (SHAMAN) has been put in to the game. It is a Level 19 spell, and available in all Shaman starting cities. This spell will only be castable in dungeons. It will not leave an icon on your screen - Shrink will last until you zone.

High level Bard song (LVL 40+) will be slightly easier to sing (less missed notes).

We have just activated the Guild submission forms in the EverQuest login server. For more information regarding the new guild submission process, please go to "Guilds" located in the "Players Guide" section of the official EverQuest web page (www.everquest.com).

July 27, 1999
------------------------------
The EverQuest servers will be coming down at 7:00 AM Pacific, tomorrow morning for an update. The estimated downtime is approximately 2 hours. This update will require a minor client-side download. The following enhancements and new features will be activated once the update is complete.

*General Announcements*

We are currently in the process of finishing up final internal testing for Tallon Zek, the new PvP-Teams server. We expect that it should be coming on-line this week. Once the date nears, a better estimate on the time of launch and further information regarding the Tallon Zek server will be made available.

The Fear Plane is now on-line. However, before adventuring to the Fear Plane, we advise you to heed the following advice:

Traveling the planes is not like visiting a dungeon. People die in dungeons.

People die hard on the planes.

Dying on a plane means that you might die in a place where your body may be extremely hard to recover, or in an area that you have no idea how to get back to. Big, nasty monsters will jump you at inopportune times, spells may work differently and once valid tactics might go right out the window.

The planes are dangerous places to adventure, and massive player slaughter will happen on a regular basis.

We are not saying this to goad you in to going - this is an honest disclaimer. So don't say we didn't warn you.

*Trade Skill Enhancements*

* Tallon Zek Update - Please Read *

Well, folks, we totally underestimated the number of people wanting to check out the PvP-Teams server and the demand is far too great for one server. Unfortunately, we were forced to bring Tallon Zek down soon after its launch because we had more than 5,000 people online at once. While the servers were still running, there was lag and the areas were simply too crowded - you players deserve a better environment than that. As a result, Tallon Zek will remain down until we can get an additional server (which will take at MINIMUM one week). I apologize for the inconvenience, and I'm sure many of you are frustrated by this. In the end, though, it's better to wait for more resources than to leave Tallon Zek up.

Brad McQuaid
Producer, EverQuest
Vice President, Verant Interactive

The Customer Service department will be staffed lightly on Sunday, August the 1st.

- The EverQuest Team

------------------------------
August 31, 1999
------------------------------

We apologize for the short notice for this Server Update, but it was neccessary to correct some problems that had arisen.

This server side patch contains the following:

1. Rangers now get Critical Hits with Bows.
2. Rogues now get Critical Hits with Thrown Weapons.
3. Parry and Dodge Skill Caps for Rangers have been raised.

5. New PvP rules: You can no longer loot any weapons that the victim had equipped in his primary, secondary, or ranged weapon slots.

Please note: This patch DOES NOT contain any changes to Necromancer's Pets, OR the Kiting/DoT changes.

report the number of charges remaining after zoning.

spellbook or sit in order to escape the effects of these spells.

bonk, bored, brb, burp, bye, cackle, calm, clap, comfort, congratulate,

PVP Changes:
- In order to make PVP combat between spellcasters and melee types more 
viable some changes to PVP spell effects have been made. All damage 
spells cast in PVP combat will do less damage to the PC than the same 
spell would do to an NPC. When a PC is under the effect of a root-type 
spell there is a 20% chance that they will break free when a direct 
damage spell is cast upon them.

Spell Changes:
- Levitate: All players may now cancel this effect.

- The Mana cost on some Magician damage shields has been slightly 
reduced.

level 49 spell.
- Curse of the Simple Mind (Enchanter) now lowers both Int AND Wis.

'train' problems that it was causing.

your tomes.

are now more easily identifiable.
- Dead Man Walking (Necromancer) has been renamed Dead Man Floating.
- Ignite Bones (Necromancer) has had the movement component removed.  
This means that it will no longer break root and snare spells, and that 
it will now stack with the darkness line.
- Syvelian`s Anti-Magic Aria (Bard) has been fixed.
- A bug in some of the AoE code has been fixed.  AoE spells will now 
effect more monsters.
- Some Magician Summoned items are now lore items.  Items that have 
turned lore have had other small benefits added to them.

Conjuration.

- High Level Enchanter Illusion spells have had the remainder of their 
effects implemented.

the world.

to /pet taunt
- The Rods for the Ice Comet quests will now pop much more often.
- Envenomed Breath (Shaman) has had its damage raised slightly.
- Scourge (Necromancer and Shaman) has had its damage raised slightly.
- Enchantment of Light and Enchantment of Brilliance (Enchanter) have 
been replaced by new enchantment spells.  These spells have been added 
to a hidden vendor somewhere in the game.
- New quests for Necromancers to research their pets have been added.

Pets:
- High level pets (44th and 49th lvl spells) do less damage
- Pets will now navigate some outdoor and dungeon areas better

DoT Changes:
- If the monster is in melee with you, there is no change to how a DoT 
spell works.
- If the monster is running away from you (fear, wounded, etc.), there 
is no change to how a DoT spell works.
- If the monster is moving when the damage from the DoT is applied 
(happens every few seconds), it will take 66% of the damage that it 
would have taken.
- DoT spells have all had their duration slightly increased.  If the 
monster moves for 18 seconds during a fight, it will take as much 
damage from the DoT as it would before the patch.  If the monster moves 
for less then 18 seconds during a fight, your DoT will do more damage 
then it would have done before the patch.  If the monster moves more 
then 18 seconds during the fight, it will take less damage then it 
would have before the patch.

*General Enhancements*

User Adjustable Clipping-plane

We have recently implemented a user adjustable clipping-plane. This will allow players with higher-end hardware to move out the distance at which the 3D world geometry is drawn into view, as well as the ability for players with lower-end hardware to pull this distance in, to further improve frame-rate. To utilize this new feature, you may do so by adjusting the clipping-plane slider bar located in the "Options"-"Display" directory, in-game. Sliding the bar left will reduce the distance at which the geometry is drawn in to view, whereas sliding the bar to the right will expand this distance. The following rules apply as to which zones the adjustable clipping-plane may be used in:

- The clipping-plane can be pushed back in outdoor zones only.
- Zones designed with heavy fog (e.g. tox, innothule, etc), the clipping-plane can only be adjusted slightly.

- If the "Misses" chat filter is set to "off", Dodge, Parry, and Reposte messages will be filtered accordingly.

Additional chat filters have been added to filter out any unwanted text.

*Zone Enhancements*

Kedge Keep has been enhanced with both new items and creatures. Please keep in mind, Kedge Keep was tested thoroughly in-house only, therefore, some additional tuning enhancements may need to be made now that it is available on the live servers.

*Class Enhancements*

Warrior - % increase on critical hits
Rogue - +8 poison resistance
Paladin - +8 disease resistance
Ranger - +4 Fire +4 Cold resistance
ShadowKnight - +4 Poison +4 Disease resistance
Monk - +8 Fire resistance

Shadowknights may now use the following spells:

- LifeTap may now be cast at level 9.
- LifeSpike may now be cast at level 15.
- LifeDraw may now be cast at level 30.

The LifeTap, LifeSpike, and LifeDraw spell scrolls may be purchased from any ShadowKnight spell vendor.

To make room for these new spells, the following spells are no longer available for ShadowKnights:

- Reclaim Energy
- Mend Bones
- Voice Graft

*Spell Enhancements*

- Level 35+ casters will now automatically meditate while sitting.

- Invoke Fear (Necromancer, Enchanter, SK, and Cleric) has both had it's casting time and mana cost reduced.
- Charm spells now message the message when they break (Enchanter, Bard, Necromancer, Druid)
- Magician pets now have new spells.

- High level Necromancer and Magician pets now look different.

- Tishan and Markar's Clash spells (Wizard) have had their casting times reduced.
- Some in-game Bardic instruments have had their stats increased to appropriate levels. Items effected are the Minotaur horn, Small Brass Trumpet, and the Drum. Some non-magic instruments have been made magic. These are the Mistmoore Battle Drums, the Lute of the Gypsy Princess and Kelin's Practice Lute.
- Bards with magic gloves and magic instruments may now punch creatures that require magic to damage.

*New Emote Animations*

The following emotes now have unique animations:

- A revision was made to a bug with Dragons, which was introduced with 
the patch last week.
- The new Necromancer spell, Summon Corpse, is now live and functioning 
as intended.

After a week of thorough testing, the Summon Corpse spell is now 
functioning properly (we promise!), and available on all servers.

- In addition, it is now possible to cast Cancel Magic on non-grouped 
players on the PvP and PvP-teams servers.
- All changes were made on the server-side, therefore no patch is 
required.

From everyone on the EverQuest team, and Verant Interactive, we would 
like to wish all of you safe and happy holidays.
