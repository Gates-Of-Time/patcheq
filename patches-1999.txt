Music works on all sound cards. If you still aren't getting music, 
double check to make sure that music is turned on in-game. In addition, 
you may not have correct drivers, and/or you may not have it set 
properly. In any case, either call our tech support or go to the tech 
support area in chat. Please be advised that music DOES have a 
performance impact on the game, although it is a small one.

Frame Rate Speedup - Our resident graphics genius sped up the game a 
fair amount. Those of you in areas like Greater Faydark should see some 
real improvements.

Corpse Bug - We've been tracking a nasty little bug that would make 
corpses disappear. I'm sure many of you know firsthand about this one. 
We finally nailed it and it should be safe to die again ;)

There's a whole bunch of other stuff that has been fixed as well and is 
listed in the patch message.

Just as an FYI we did find a server-side bug that's been fixed and we 
will probably have to down the servers one at a time to update since 
this bug is one that really needs to be fixed.

One final Item: Yes, glide on banshee's is coming back. It should be in 
later this week.

Hello All,

I waited until it was 7:30pm pst tonight to write this update. I wanted to make sure things were stable before I wrote this. Lately every time I give an update something bad happened right after I sent it.

Here's a summary of what was done in the last 2 days

1) We did a major hardware upgrade to our primary router here in San 
Diego.
2) We worked with CERFnet to do a router upgrade to their facility here 
in San Diego.
3) We moved Karana over to CERFnet
4) We brought up Rodcet Nife

I think you will find now that the packet loss should be basically 
gone... at least on our end. We were definetely causing some of the 
loss before (only when we hit major numbers) but now things are very, 
very clean running and that is with 23,582 people on just as I write 
this (a new record).

Does this mean that EVERYONE'S Packet Loss is gone? Absolutely not. 
BUT, I did some surveys in most of the worlds and about 750f the people 
told me their Packet Loss was great. If you are having problems now, do 
a traceroute to chat.everquest.com and send it to the email address 
traceroute@verant.com and we will take a look. We take our customers 
connections very seriously, and if a whole lot of people on one network 
are having a problem we will do our best to look into it. It doesn't 
mean we can always get the reaction we want (some networks are just 
plain bad) but many times we can help find a legitimate problem and 
help correct it.

Some of you may also not realize what the network statistics we have in game actually are for:

The left hand number is your ping to the server in milliseconds.

The left-middle number (percentage) is your packet loss to the server.
The right-middle number (percentage) is your packet loss from the server.
The right hand number is the data rate. THIS IS NOT THE PING. - I love hearing about the "terrible" pings in game of 3000.
It is my strong belief (forgive me for this rant) that EVERY online game should have this type of meter so that you are getting real feedback about the network status.

John Smedley

Thanks!

As posted yesterday, we will be bringing down all of the servers at midnight tonight PDT, for a server-side update. Our estimated downtime is should be less than two hours. The fixes/changes are listed below.

1) Traveling by boat should be much more stable.
2) A few various zone crashes.
3) The corpse class tag will not be listed as "Unknown".
4) Players will be given text messages for items that they cannot obtain while looting a corpse, instead of the item disappearing.
5) A number of quests and combat related exploits were fixed.
6) Characters are no longer able to use the disarm command while using feign death.

We will also be putting up a new client patch on Monday at Midnight as well. A list of the client-side changes will be posted on Monday morning.

We will be patching a new version of the EverQuest client executable tonight at Midnight PDT. One of the significant additions is the option to utilize auto mip-mapping in Glide mode. Mip-mapping may be activated in the Display menu, located within the Options directory. In addition, we have made numerous bug fixes and game play adjustments, of which are listed below.

1) If you have participated in a fight against an NPC, you will take a faction hit.
2) Players may no longer disarm an NPC that has a magical weapon armed.
3) Safe-fall is now working as intended, however, damage from falling is required to advance in the skill.
4) Players should not see other characters "popping" around while riding the boats.
5) Trades will properly cancel out when the characters involved walk away.
6) The Friend's List is now functioning as intended.
7) A few crash bugs related to failed font calls have been resolved.
8) Creature and Player corpses should no longer draw into the overlays.
9) Vampiric Embrace has been modified from it's original design to improve game play.
10) A number of quest were implemented.

Included in tonight's update is a major enhancement to the populations of both Solusek's Eye and Mistmoore.

Tomorrow night, a revised version of the EverQuest Manual will be patched. The revision will include a new section which outlines the spells and skills that have been modified from their original design to enhance game play.

May 4th, 8:30pm
------------------------------

The login difficulties that you may have been encountering over the past 1.5 hours have been resolved. We were able to pinpoint and fix
a major bug which has been plaguing the login procedure for quite some time. Now that this problem has been addressed, the login
process should be carried out much more swiftly. We apologize for the inaccessibility of the EverQuest servers for this short time,
however, this fix should insure future stability.

We have included a revised version of the EverQuest Manual in this patch which includes an amendment to various skills, spells and other game play releated features. The section briefly outlines the modification, introduction, and removal of various features found in EverQuest. This information may also be found at www.everquest.com in the "In Development" section located in "Features". Both of these will be updated on a regular basis.

New emotes:

PVP Changes:

viable some changes to PVP spell effects have been made. All damage 
spells cast in PVP combat will do less damage to the PC than the same 
spell would do to an NPC. When a PC is under the effect of a root-type 
spell there is a 20% chance that they will break free when a direct 
damage spell is cast upon them.

- Levitate: All players may now cancel this effect.

- The Mana cost on some Magician damage shields has been slightly 
reduced.

'train' problems that it was causing.

your tomes.
- The different types of Words of Collection and Words of Acquisition 
are now more easily identifiable.
- Dead Man Walking (Necromancer) has been renamed Dead Man Floating.
- Ignite Bones (Necromancer) has had the movement component removed.  
This means that it will no longer break root and snare spells, and that 
it will now stack with the darkness line.
- Syvelian`s Anti-Magic Aria (Bard) has been fixed.
- A bug in some of the AoE code has been fixed.  AoE spells will now 
effect more monsters.
- Some Magician Summoned items are now lore items.  Items that have 
turned lore have had other small benefits added to them.
- Dance of the Fireflies (Druid) has been changed from Divination to 
Conjuration.

- High Level Enchanter Illusion spells have had the remainder of their 
effects implemented.

the world.

to /pet taunt
- The Rods for the Ice Comet quests will now pop much more often.
- Envenomed Breath (Shaman) has had its damage raised slightly.
- Scourge (Necromancer and Shaman) has had its damage raised slightly.
- Enchantment of Light and Enchantment of Brilliance (Enchanter) have 
been replaced by new enchantment spells.  These spells have been added 
to a hidden vendor somewhere in the game.
- New quests for Necromancers to research their pets have been added.

Pets:
- High level pets (44th and 49th lvl spells) do less damage
- Pets will now navigate some outdoor and dungeon areas better

DoT Changes:
- If the monster is in melee with you, there is no change to how a DoT 
spell works.
- If the monster is running away from you (fear, wounded, etc.), there 
is no change to how a DoT spell works.
- If the monster is moving when the damage from the DoT is applied 
(happens every few seconds), it will take 66% of the damage that it 
would have taken.
- DoT spells have all had their duration slightly increased.  If the 
monster moves for 18 seconds during a fight, it will take as much 
damage from the DoT as it would before the patch.  If the monster moves 
for less then 18 seconds during a fight, your DoT will do more damage 
then it would have done before the patch.  If the monster moves more 
then 18 seconds during the fight, it will take less damage then it 
would have before the patch.

player, the group members will be given the exp. and looting rights).

new class specific quests to obtain the new armor are now in for each 
class that could wear Rubicite.

the products of a quest.

*General Enhancements*

User Adjustable Clipping-plane

We have recently implemented a user adjustable clipping-plane. This will allow players with higher-end hardware to move out the distance at which the 3D world geometry is drawn into view, as well as the ability for players with lower-end hardware to pull this distance in, to further improve frame-rate. To utilize this new feature, you may do so by adjusting the clipping-plane slider bar located in the "Options"-"Display" directory, in-game. Sliding the bar left will reduce the distance at which the geometry is drawn in to view, whereas sliding the bar to the right will expand this distance. The following rules apply as to which zones the adjustable clipping-plane may be used in:

- The clipping-plane can be pushed back in outdoor zones only.
- Zones designed with heavy fog (e.g. tox, innothule, etc), the clipping-plane can only be adjusted slightly.

- If the "Misses" chat filter is set to "off", Dodge, Parry, and Reposte messages will be filtered accordingly.

Additional chat filters have been added to filter out any unwanted text.

*Zone Enhancements*

Kedge Keep has been enhanced with both new items and creatures. Please keep in mind, Kedge Keep was tested thoroughly in-house only, therefore, some additional tuning enhancements may need to be made now that it is available on the live servers.

*Class Enhancements*

Warrior - % increase on critical hits
Rogue - +8 poison resistance
Paladin - +8 disease resistance
Ranger - +4 Fire +4 Cold resistance
ShadowKnight - +4 Poison +4 Disease resistance
Monk - +8 Fire resistance

Shadowknights may now use the following spells:

- LifeTap may now be cast at level 9.
- LifeSpike may now be cast at level 15.
- LifeDraw may now be cast at level 30.

The LifeTap, LifeSpike, and LifeDraw spell scrolls may be purchased from any ShadowKnight spell vendor.

To make room for these new spells, the following spells are no longer available for ShadowKnights:

- Reclaim Energy
- Mend Bones
- Voice Graft

*Spell Enhancements*

- Level 35+ casters will now automatically meditate while sitting.

- Invoke Fear (Necromancer, Enchanter, SK, and Cleric) has both had it's casting time and mana cost reduced.
- Charm spells now message the message when they break (Enchanter, Bard, Necromancer, Druid)
- Magician pets now have new spells.
- Ensnare (Druid) has had it's casting time reduced.
- High level Necromancer and Magician pets now look different.
- Illusions (Enchanter) have had their duration increased.
- Tishan and Markar's Clash spells (Wizard) have had their casting times reduced.
- Some in-game Bardic instruments have had their stats increased to appropriate levels. Items effected are the Minotaur horn, Small Brass Trumpet, and the Drum. Some non-magic instruments have been made magic. These are the Mistmoore Battle Drums, the Lute of the Gypsy Princess and Kelin's Practice Lute.
- Bards with magic gloves and magic instruments may now punch creatures that require magic to damage.

*New Emote Animations*

The following emotes now have unique animations:

/bored /yawn /agree /amaze
/boggle /gasp /apologize /plead
/grovel /applaud /clap /bleed
/hungry /blush /cackle /chuckle
