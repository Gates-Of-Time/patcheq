    *** Highlights ***

    - Big bags are returning to Norrath for a limited time! Special larger bags will be available on the Marketplace starting at noon (PDT) on July 2nd. Act quickly, as they will disappear after July 6th!


    *** Items ***

    - Girdle of the Weaponmaster - The focus effect Boon of the Seeress has been adjusted to include the number of spells that it previously focused, prior to a number of data changes to AA spells.


    *** Quests & Events ***

    - Aranaea the Cleaver - Fixed an issue with the use of the Arcanist's Ignitor in the Plane of War. Burn it all down!
    - Seductive Subterfuge - The task step to "Banish the skeletons, spirits, and banshees" in this Caverns of Endless Song heroic adventure now requires 9 kills instead of 10.


    *** Spells ***

    - Enchanter - Corrected an issue with the way that damage shield damage from items is calculated in order to fix a problem with the Ward line of spells. Damage shield damage from items will now only be added to your total damage shield amount if your effective Damage Shield total is greater than 0.
    - Corrected an issue with player cast spells that trigger an additional spell when the first spell fades. The second spell will now properly use the original caster's focus effects and send damage messages to the correct person.
    - AoE resurrection abilities will now properly land on corpses in hover mode.


    *** NPC ***

    - Original EQ bosses are now immune to memory blur effects.

    Magician - Updated Theft of Essence to include the three ranks of the level 103 summoned bane damage spell "Eradicate the Unnatural" as a possible trigger for the "Theft of Essence" pet buff.
    Magician - Corrected a bug that caused rank 6 of Extended Fire Core to extend the duration of all spells by 36 seconds rather than extending the duration of just the "Fire Core" AA spells.


    *** Progression Servers ***

    - The Hole, Kedge Keep, Permafrost Keep, and Nagafen's Lair will spin up new load balanced versions when they are populated by enough adventurers. There is no hard limit to the number of adventurers that can be in any particular version of these zones. Raid NPCs will only spawn in the base instance of these zones.
    - The Commonlands can now support many more simultaneous adventurers before it is full.
    - Raid bosses will provide more of a challenge on progression servers. They will also spawn more frequently but with more randomization between spawn times.
    - The residents of the Plane of Hate and Plane of Fear will spawn more frequently.


    *** Miscellaneous ***

    - /outputfile will now tell you it's complete in chat. Also if you use /outputfile with an invalid option, it will output the usage message.
    - Shadowrest - Corrected an issue that could potentially result in a player becoming stuck in Shadowrest. If the location from which you entered has been cleared, you will now be sent to your original starting location rather than your bind point.


    *** UI ***

    - Merc AAs - Made the cost column display nothing when the max rank has been purchased.
    - Added the current count of players in your current /pickzone instance to the window.
    - When a player is in a load balanced zone (/pickzone) they will now display their instance number in /who.

    *** Highlights ***

    - Proc effect stacking - Multiple procs can now trigger from the same triggering action. Each proc effect that is active will be processed independently. See the Spells section for details.
    - Damage shields now report the damage that they do in all cases and can be directed to chat filters.
    - Spells that do not take hold will now relay a more accurate description as to why they did not take hold.
    - A new item, the Legend of the Oathbreaker, is available with prizes from the Legends of Norrath sets Oathbreaker, Ethernauts, and Against the Void.
    - Journeyman's Rucksacks and Journeyman's Pocketed Rucksacks are now available for purchase year-round on all servers that have Omens of War unlocked.


    *** Spells ***

    - Beastlord - The Nature's Fury line of spells will now correctly reduce offhand damage from damage shields, instead of increasing it.
    - Magician - Summon spells such as Call of the Hero no longer cause their target to dismount, unless the location that the target is being summoned to is too small of an area for that target to have summoned a mount.
    - Spells that do not take hold will now relay a more accurate description as to why they did not take hold.
    - Reduced the critical chance for all rain spells level 96 and above.
    - The Spell Critical Chance spell effect has been split into separate Critical Chance and Critical Damage effects. Spells that affected one or the other have been changed to have equivalent effects.
    - Proc effect stacking - Changed how buffs that trigger effects when spells and skills are used ("procs") interact with each other. All procs now have the ability to cast concurrently. This changes previous behavior that only allowed one proc spell to be cast at a time.
    - - Example one: For a player using the Bone Staff of Wickedness and the buff Spirit of the Puma, it is now possible for both effects to proc independently each melee round. Under the previous rules, players could only cast one or the other spell per melee round.
    - - Example two: For a player wielding Kyzer's Ritual Dagger augmented with The Murderer's Heart, it is now possible for both effects to proc independently each time that player casts an appropriate detrimental spell. Under the previous rules, players could only cast one or the other spell per appropriate detrimental spell cast.
    - Spells can now be defined as belonging to a Spell Stacking Group. Inspecting a spell that belongs to a Spell Stacking Group will list the name of that group and the rank of that spell within the group in the spell inspection window.
    - Assigned Spell Stacking Groups to buffs that trigger effects when casting spells or using skills in order to support the fact that you can now have multiple buffs with these effects active at the same time.
    - - Examples: Mana Reiteration Rk. III (which is now rank 22 of the "Mana Flare" stacking group) will now be overwritten by Mana Reciprocation Rk. III (which is now rank 40 of the "Mana Flare" stacking group).
    - - Mana Reciprocation Rk. III will *not* be overwritten by Ancient Hedgewizard Brew because Ancient Hedgewizard Brew is part of the stacking group "Resonant Tonics".
    - Damage shield damage is now considered magical non-melee damage; this means that melee guard and melee threshold guard spell effects will no longer negate damage shield damage. Rune, spell guard, spell threshold guard, and spells that allow you to absorb damage as mana will continue to block damage shield damage.
    - Taking damage from a damage shield is now an action that can decrement the use counter on some limited use spells.
    - A number of changes have been implemented regarding damage shield and environmental damage messages:
    - - Changed damage shield message filters from "Show All/Hide All" to "Show All/Show Mine/Hide All."
    - - Added the ability to filter environmental damage messages for other players as "Show All/Hide All."
    - - Added the ability to set individual colors for incoming, outgoing and others' damage shield messages, and to filter them to separate windows.
    - - Damage shield messages will now display the amount of damage dealt by a defender to an attacker. Damage assignment has not changed; damage from damage shields is still not assigned to an owner.
    - - Damage shield messages will now display the correct message if the amount of damage being taken was negated by spell effects such as rune or spell guard.
    - - Changed the filter for spell effects that cause the bearer to take damage when they attack (such as the cleric "Mark" line of spells) so they are reported as damage shield damage. These spell effects now message the amount of damage the attacker takes.
    - - Changed the filter for spell effects that cause the caster of a detrimental spell to take damage ("feedback" spells) so they are reported as damage shield damage. These spell effects now message the amount of damage the caster takes.
    - - Created new filters and assignable colors for environmental damage messages (such as burning in lava, drowning, suffocating, freezing in ice, falling, or being hit by a trap). They are no longer filtered as if they were damage shield messages.
    - Adjusted the spell names and the 'spell landed' and 'spell wore off' messages on a number of spells to reduce the cases where dissimilar spell lines shared the same messages or where multiple spells shared the same name.


    *** AA ***

    - Corrected a display issue that could occur when two existing AA lines were consolidated into a single line.
    - Activated AA abilities that have their timer refunded because their spell failed to take hold or affect a target can no longer trigger spell procs.
    - Enchanter - Retuned Gift of Hazy Thoughts to grant a more consistent but lower damage increase. Gift of Hazy Thoughts now triggers Gift of Chromatic Haze rather than Chromatic Haze VI, and can now be triggered by casting damage over time or stun spells in addition to direct damage spells. Gift of Chromatic Haze has a much lower damage focus than Chromatic Haze VI.
    - Enchanter - Ranks 1-21 of the AA ability line Nightmare Stasis have been consolidated into ranks 4-24 of the Stasis AA ability line. The /alt act number for Nightmare Stasis (previously 748) is now 409. The functionality of Waking Nightmares, triggered when ranks 4-24 of Stasis breaks, remains unchanged.
    - Enchanter - Fixed a bug that prevented the AA ability line Quickened Stasis from shortening the cast time of ranks 4-24 of Stasis.
    - Enchanter - The AA ability line Hastened Nightmare Stasis has been renamed Hastened Stasis.
    - Enchanter - Fixed a bug with the AA ability line Profound Visage. The ability line now multiplies the base effectiveness of the visage buffs by 20% per rank. (Ex. Rank 6 now allows the bearer of Horrifying Visage to generate 22% more aggro, up from its base 10%.)
    - Enchanter - The AA ability line Surreality has been renamed Hastened Mind Over Matter.
    - Enchanter - The AA ability line Doppelganger's Beckon has been renamed Hastened Doppelganger.
    - Enchanter - The buff triggered by the AA ability Gracious Gift of Mana has been renamed Gracious Gift of Mana 96 to 105 and has had its messages updated to more closely match other "Gift of Mana" spells.
    - Enchanter - Corrected a bug with the AA ability Hastened Mesmerization that prevented it from functioning on level 86 through 89 and level 100 to 105 spells.
    - Enchanter - Ranks 1-6 of the AA ability line Mana Draw have been consolidated into ranks 2-7 of Gather Mana. The AA ability line Hastened Gathering has been renamed Hastened Gather Mana. Ranks 1-3 of the AA ability line Hastened Mana Draw have been consolidated into ranks 3-5 of Hastened Gather Mana.
    - Enchanter - Corrected a bug with the AA ability line Forceful Banishment that prevented it from working on ranks 2-4 of Beguiler's Banishment.


    *** Progression Servers ***

    - Hunting zones in The Ruins of Kunark will spin up new load balancing versions when they are populated by enough adventurers.
    - Many of the bosses in the Plane of Sky, the Plane of Hate, and the Plane of Fear will provide more of a challenge on Progression Servers.
    - Antonican Traveler's Bags and Antonican Traveler's Rucksacks are now available for purchase year-round on Progression Servers.


    *** Miscellaneous ***

    - Added /pickzone fewestplayers to automatically pick the zone with the lowest number of players.
    - Fixed a bug that would very occasionally cause you to appear unconscious even though you were full health after a divine save.
    - NPCs that are in combat and are pushed by spells with a knockback component should no longer teleport directly to their most hated target if their most hated target remains stationary.
    - NPCs that are pushed by spells with a knockback component should appear in their new location more quickly than before.


    *** UI ***

    - When viewing achievements from chat you will now see the category and sub-category that the achievement is from in the Achievements window.
    - Added the ability to open an achievement in the achievements window when viewing an achievement from chat by clicking "View Mine".

*** Highlights ***

- - Renamed these spells to follow a simpler standardization.
- - Robes obtained in The Darkened Sea (excluding Castaway Robe of the Conjuror) will now focus Bolt of Molten Shieldstone rather than Bolt of Molten Magma.
- - Increased the amount of focus damage that TDS robes will add to Bolt of Molten Shieldstone.
- - The Companion's Strikes triggered by the TDS robes can now be cast when your pet backstabs in addition to when it bashes. This gives the water pet the ability to utilize this buff.
- - Corrected several inconsistencies where some robes in the series were casting a lower level version of the bolt focus spell than they should have been.
- The Doljonijiarnimorinar axe now has a positive weight instead of a negative weight.


*** Quests & Events ***

- A cold wind blows through the caverns below the spires that sit at the center of Luclin's deadliest mountains. Practitioners of the dark arts may be interested in seeking this out.
- Plane of Sky - The Djinn quest givers that inhabit the halls below the first island have had their respawn time reduced from 2.4 hours to 20 minutes.
- Alerts have been created for Living Legacy and Brew Day events!
- Alerts for recurring events should show up again if you had dismissed them in years past.


*** Spells ***

- Damage dealt by a defender to their attacker as a result of a damage shield will no longer display two lines of text when this damage is dealt.
- Implemented a new timer ID (-1) for melee abilities that allows them to be used independently.
- Beastlord - Reduced the skill damage modifier on the caster's portion of Bestial Fury Discipline and Empathic Fury by 50, Savage Fury by 13-16, and Savage Rage by 10-16 due to innate AA increases. This is designed to keep melee burns the same (or higher) while increasing damage at all other times.
- Berserker - Moved all axe summoning abilities from timer 7 to timer -1.
- Berserker - All abilities that summon multiple axes now have a 4 second cast time and 12 second recast time.
- Berserker - Reduced the skill damage modifier by 50 on Blind Rage Discipline and Berserking Discipline, Sundering Discipline by 33, and Brutal Discipline by 30 due to innate AA increases. This is designed to keep melee burns the same (or higher) while increasing damage at all other times.

*** AA ***

- Implemented the following changes in an effort to create an overall increase in damage over time while leaving the damage dealt under the effects of short duration (burn) disciplines at least what it was previously.
- - Starting at level 40 and extending to level 105, all non-caster classes will be granted ranks in a passive AA ability line that increases overall melee damage dealt with all skill types. The percentage increase starts at 10% and increases to 50% by level 65 for all classes. For levels 70 through 105 the percentage increase scales differently per class.
- Ranger - Created a new AA ability called Gladestrider's Leap. It is available starting at level 85 from the Underfoot expansion.
- Ranger - All ranks of the Journeyman's Speed ability now reduce the re-use time for Gladestrider's Leap.
- All pet classes now have an activated AA ability called Companion's Calm Demeanor. This ability, when activated, will reduce the hatred generated by your summoned pets by 40%.
- Enchanter - Renamed the ability Deep Sleep to Projected Somnolence.
- Enchanter - Projected Somnolence retains the chance to trigger Deep Sleep on a mesmerized target, but now also has a 100% chance to trigger Somnolence when the enchanter casts a level 65 or higher cripple spell.
- - Each rank of Somnolence is an equivalent accuracy debuff to each rank of Deep Sleep but does not offer the attack speed debuff (Deep Sleep's Malaise) imparted by rank 6 and higher of Deep Sleep.
- Magician - Fixed the following issues with the line "Frenzied Burnout":
- - Ranks 1-9 now have a functioning flurry chance. This chance is additive with the owner's passive pet flurry chance AA abilities. (The flurry chance on Ranks 7-9 previously did not function for pets.)
- - Ranks 1-9 now have a defined rampage chance. Note: a pet's rampage attacks will not break mesmerization. (Previously, only rank 1 of this AA line and no other had a special case that caused the magician's pet alternate flurry chance and rampage chance. This special case for rank 1 has been removed and now ranks 1-9 have a defined rampage chance.)
- Warrior - Corrected a bug that prevented the ability Dual-Wielding Proficiency from being activated if the warrior had a piercing weapon in their primary hand and a one-handed blunt weapon in their secondary hand.


*** Progression Servers ***

- Increased the maximum number of adventurers that can be in any load balanced version of the Commonlands.
- Many of the bosses in the Ruins of Kunark will provide more of a challenge on Progression Servers. Bosses in the Ruins of Kunark will only spawn in the base version of their zone.
- Returned the defensive skill values of level 1-65 magician and necromancer pets to match what they were in the Planes of Power era. This will only affect Progression Servers until LDoN unlocks on the server. These changes have no impact on other live servers.
- Raid targets that were previously increased in power on Progression Servers now have the ability Mark of the Old Ways. This will reduce the resistances and melee damage output and increase incoming melee damage of Magician and Necromancer pets with increasing severity based on the total number of those pets that are attacking the raid target.
- Progression raid targets have had their difficulty reduced, particularly in the Plane of Sky.


*** Miscellaneous ***

- Link-dead (LD) players will no longer be immediately removed from the world.
- /quit now works like /exit.
- Fixed a bug that caused certain raid bosses to stop appearing in instances on live servers. This primarily impacted Lady Vox and Lord Nagafen in Old Man McKenzie's Ancient Heroes missions.


*** UI ***

- Extended target slots set to display targets that don't exist will now not render a lifebar rather than displaying an empty lifebar with the name "------".


- Changed -


*** Previously Updated ***

- Addressed some world stability issues related to spam filtering.
- You will no longer crash when trying to "View Mine" for an achievement that you cannot view.
- Lowered the AC values of many NPCs in the Arx Mentis raids by up to 45 percent. This should allow melee hits to land for higher damage against these targets.

Game Update Notes: September 23, 2015
------------------------------
Source: https://forums.daybreakgames.com/eq/index.php?threads/game-update-notes-september-23-2015.226759/

*** Highlights ***

- Modified the way that a weapons damage bonus is calculated. This should result in increased weapon damage bonuses, especially for two-handed weapons.
- Most clickable buff items will now grant you a passive AA ability with a permanent effect! See the Items section for details.
- Look out for new Nights of the Dead items available in the Marketplace, beginning October first!
- Made several changes to the way Fading Memories and other escape abilities work. Please see the AA section for details.


*** Items ***

- Keep an eye on the Marketplace starting in October for new and returning Nights of the Dead items! You'll be delighted to find sinister mounts like the Dark Direhound, horrifying weapon visuals like the Nightmare ornaments, fiendish familiars like the Cat in a Bag, Player Studio offerings, and much much more!
- Updated the way that the alternate advancement ability Sinister Strikes functions. The ability now grants weapons wielded in your offhand a percentage of your weapons damage bonus. This change allows the ability to grant an effect for weapons with a delay lower than 30 and will better scale to higher damage weapons.
- Fixed an issue that would cause items to be deleted if you tried to send them to a player that doesn't exist.
- The server is no longer alcohol powered and no longer requires a sacrifice of an alcoholic beverage when you drink an alcoholic beverage.
- Changed the following buff lines that result from activating items so that their effects grant the bearer passive AA abilities: Ancestral Memories, Aura of Battle, Breath of Atathus, Expanding Mind, Form of Defense, Form of Endurance, Form of Protection, Form of Rejuvenation, Grim Aura, Knowledge of the Past / Soothing Breath, Might of Stone, Myrmidons Skill, and Prismatic Ward.
- - Activating an item with one of these spells grants you a passive AA ability at a rank that matches the power of the buff. (Activating an item with a weaker buff will not lower your passive AA ability rank.)
- - Activating an item with one of these spells now casts a shadow spell named for the buff line. These shadow spells have no effects but are permanent duration and are intended to allow you to retain the use of these items as a means to reduce the impact of incoming dispel attacks.
- - When you are granted a rank of one of these passive AA abilities you are now also granted an activated ability called Item: Disable Item Abilities. This ability will clear all of your item-granted abilities and allow you to start fresh.
- Extended the spell durations of the following item buff lines: Aura of the Void, Essence of Ruaabri, Gnoll Reaver Fortitude, Gunthak Grit / Fortitude, Illusionary Spikes, and Thorny Shield. They all have a permanent duration and persist through death.
- Fixed a problem that could cause some items to be lost when unpacking a suit of Hero's Forge armor.


*** Quests & Events ***

- Look to the marketplace this October for the Cat in a Bag. Each one contains a random adoptable cat familiar. Trade them to your friends or collect them all yourself, and keep an eye out for the easily terrified Scaredy Cat familiar and always agitated Cranky Cat familiar!


*** Spells ***

- Spells can now have more than one focus effect at a time, similar to AAs.
- Melee skills that apply buffs to the caster no longer require a target in order to work.
- Shadowknight - Adjusted the hatred multiplier for the gift recourse from the line of Touch spells to be as good or better than the highest rank of the AA ability Voice of Thule that is available at each level range.
- Spells that allow you to gravitate your target toward your location have been modified so that they only function on targets up to level 100. This applies to Compliant Lurch and Forceful Attraction.


*** NPC ***

- Reviewed the majority of enemies in Call of the Forsaken and The Darkened Sea zones with regards to immunity to runspeed changes, mesmerization, stun, lull, charm, and fear, and removed or relaxed restrictions on most NPCs.
- Fixed some enemies that were immune to fling and gravitate effects but would allow players to attempt to cast on them. These spell now fail immediately upon casting on these immune enemies rather than upon landing. This applies primarily to raid encounters and encounters in the Plane of War.


*** AA ***

- Passive AA abilities that modify the amount of hatred generated by the player's actions can now be toggled on and off. This change means these abilities can now be auto-granted to all classes, and allowed us to refund the activated AA ability Negation of Subtlety.
- The AA abilities Knowledge of Alaran Culture and Advanced Knowledge of Alaran Culture have been removed. All Veil of Alaris AA abilities that required the purchase of Advanced Knowledge of Alaran Culture have had that restriction removed.
- Consolidated All bind-wound-related AA ability lines (Bandage Wound, Mithaniel's Binding, Field Dressing, and Combat Medic) into a single general line called Bandage Wounds.
- Consolidated the general innate statistic lines (Innate Strength, Innate Agility, etc) and the statistic cap lines (Planar Strength, Planar Agility, etc) into single ability lines in order to reduce UI clutter in the AA window. For example: Planar Strength is now rank 16 of Innate Strength.
- Glyph of the Indeterminable Reward and Glyph of Unfathomable Reward no longer share a re-use timer with the other Glyph AA abilities.
- Corrected an issue with the Ageless Enmity and Area Taunt AA abilities that prevented them from adding the intended amount of hatred over the previously most hated target.
- The passive AA ability Spell Casting Reinforcement no longer extends the duration of invulnerability spells.
- Unobtainable ranks of Hero's Vitality, Hero's Fortitude, and Hero's Resolution no longer display in the Special tab of the AA window. Newer ranks of the ability are displayed as they become available as rewards for completing content.
- Beastlord - Renamed the AA ability line Extended Feralgia to Extended Moongrowl and corrected it to work on level 105 spells.
- Beastlord - Corrected an issue with the AA Extended Bloodlust that prevented it from extending the duration of the second rank of the Bloodlust ability.
- Beastlord - Renamed the AA ability line Spell Casting Subtlety to Combat Subtlety and updated its description to better reflect the fact that hatred generated by both spells and melee combat is affected by this line.
- Beastlord - Corrected a bug with the passive AA ability Extended Moongrowl that prevented it from extending the duration of the Growl of the Leopard and Feralgia lines of spells as intended.
- Beastlord - Adjusted the required level, expansion and costs for the Shaman and Beastlord versions of the AA abilities Shrink and Group Shrink. This corrects an issue that prevented the beastlord version of the AA ability Shrink from displaying.
- Berserker - Renamed the AA ability line Echoing Cries to Extended War Cry.
- Berserker - Removed the ability for the self-damage component of the AA ability Agony of Absolution to apply critical damage.
- Berserker - Updated the AA ability line Axe of Rallos to function with the level 105 skill Axe of Numicia.

- Berserker - The AA ability line Decapitate no longer reports "Your target does not meet the spell requirements" when melee attacking targets that are above the level in which the ability can trigger. Instead, the decapitating blow will deal 0 damage to targets that are too high of a level for this ability.
- Berserker - Furious Rampage now places a visible buff on you to indicate its duration and to allow you to remove the effect early if needed.
- Berserker - Created Focused Furious Rampage, a new AA ability that allows you the same number of additional combat rounds on a single target.
- Enchanter - Changed the re-use times of all enchant material AA abilities from 1 to 8 hours to 10 to 60 seconds. These abilities now share two re-use timers (one for mass and one for single use).
- Monk - Destructive Force now places a visible buff on you to indicate its duration and to allow you to remove the effect early if needed.
- Monk - Extra melee rounds granted from Destructive Force now have the ability to trigger additional hits from double attack, etc.
- Monk - Created Focused Destructive Force, a new AA ability that allows you the same number of additional combat rounds on a single target.
- Monk - Updated the AA ability Hastened Destructive Force to function on both Destructive Force and Focused Destructive Force.
- Rogue - Rakes Rampage now places a visible buff on you to indicate its duration and to allow you to remove the effect early if needed.
- Rogue - Created Focused Rakes Rampage, a new AA ability that allows you the same number of additional combat rounds on a single target.
- Paladin - Modified the AA ability Beacon of the Righteous so that it will now impart its instantaneous hatred component even if the stun and hatred over time components of the ability are resisted.
- Paladin - Changed the resist modifier for Divine Call to be more in line with other gravitate and fling abilities.
- Paladin and Shadowknight - Added a new passive ability line, Bold Attacks, that increases the amount of hatred generated by your actions. Reduced the effective hate percentages for the activated AA abilities Voice of Thule and Marr's Salvation so that maximum hate generation is close to the same amount.
- Warrior - Added more ranks to the passive AA ability line Bold Attacks and extended the line to lower levels to match the levels that the Paladin and Shadowknight version of this AA ability line become available.
- Warrior - The buff applied when using Rage of the Forsaken has had its duration and aggro multiplier reduced to better reflect intended values with the recent changes to Bold Attacks.
- Warrior - Renamed the AA ability line Hastened Defiance to Hastened Warlords Tenacity and re-ordered the ranks to reflect their proper power growth.
- Warrior - All ranks of the AA ability Warlords Tenacity now count down in buff-frozen zones.
- Warrior - Modified Warlord's Grasp so that the improved taunt portion of the ability will continue to function even if the target is immune to the gravity portion of the ability.
- Warrior - Sneering Grin ranks 1-3 have been changed to be a toggled passive ability.
- Wizard - Modified the AA abilities Frenzied Devastation and Sustained Devastation so that only the spells focused by these abilities will use charges and receive the focus effect.
- - Adjusted the mana cost component of these abilities to make them less mana efficient.
- - Improved the number of charges slightly for Frenzied Devastation and substantially for Sustained Devastation.
- - Improved the chance to critically cast granted by Sustained Devastation.
- - Created two additional ranks of Sustained Devastation to better match the available ranks of Frenzied Devastation
- Made a number of changes to AA abilities that allow players to escape from combat:
- - Corrected a bug that ignored any chance to escape from combat that was set below 100% on spells that did not have a duration.
- - Changed the invisibility component of abilities that allow you to escape. Now, upon successfully rolling your escape chance, if you are at least 30 feet away from all targets that have you high (top 10) on their hatelist, you will have a spell cast on you. In most cases this spell is an invisibility buff.
- - Modified the Cleric ability Divine Peace, the Paladin ability Balefire Burst, the Warrior ability Howl of the Warlord, and the Berserker ability Self Preservation to apply a sanctuary buff upon a successful escape rather than invisibility.
- - The distance restriction for the added spell component of these abilities does not apply to the hatelist removal functionality. There is no minimum distance for removing yourself from the hatelists of qualifying NPCs.
- - Put level restrictions in place on all escape abilities. Starting at level 75 most classes are only able to immediately escape combat from NPCs that are yellow con (player level +3) or lower. Exceptions to this are Rogues, Bards, Monks, Shadowknights and Rangers who can escape from NPCs that are up to 5 levels higher. AA abilities available prior to level 71 now work on creatures up to level 75.
- - All classes with escape AA abilities now have new 0 cost ranks available at each level increase that they did not previously have purchasable ranks. These 0 cost ranks increase the maximum level that the abilities will function on.
- - Bard - Increased mana cost for higher level ranks of the AA ability Fading Memories by approximately 3% per player level.
- - Ranger - Removed mana cost for the AA ability Cover Tracks and increased its success rate from 50-70-85% to 60-75-90%.
- - Magician - Combined the AA abilities Drape of Shadows and Cloak of Shadows into a single ability line Drape of Shadows which provides a chance for the Magician to escape from combat and a guaranteed chance for their pet to escape from combat. The combined ability does not require the Magician's pet to be up for the Magician to escape from combat. Merged the Magician passive abilities Hastened Drape of Shadows and Hastened Cloak of Shadows into a single line which provides a 4.5 minute reduction to the reuse time of the combined ability at max rank.
- - Shadowknight - The spell Rigor Mortis will be modified in a later patch to correctly cap the level of targets that it functions on and Last Gasp, Last Breath, Final Gasp and Terminal Breath will be updated with similar functionality to Rigor Mortis. For now, Rigor Mortis is capped at level 109.

- Modified all AA abilities that allow you to fling or gravitate your target to your location so they function only on NPC targets below your current level. Added new 0 cost ranks at every level to increase the level range that the abilities will function on. This applies to Lure of the Siren's Song, Divine Call, Moving Mountains, Warlord's Grasp, and Hate's Attraction.

- - Magician - Small Modulation Shard, Medium Modulation Shard, and Large Modulation Shard are now ranks 1-3 of a combined line: Summon Modulation Shard.

The number of charges has been improved slightly for Frenzied Devastation and substantially for Sustained Devastation. The chance to critically cast granted by 'Sustained Devastation' has been improved. Two additional ranks of Sustained Devastation have been created to better match the available ranks of Frenzied Devastation.

- Corrected the following issues with the AA abilities Projection of Doom, Projection of Fury, and Projection of Piety:
- - Multiple projections can now be used on a single target. Previously, if multiple projections were used on the same target only the most recently summoned pet would transfer aggro to the caster.
- - Corrected a bug where the caster would have their aggro value with the target set to the amount of hate generated by the pet rather than increased by the amount of hate generated by the pet. Previously, if the ability was used late into a fight, it could result in a net loss of hate with the target.

*** Progression Servers ***

- Removed the maximum player limit for the following Kunark zones: Karnor's Castle, The Dreadlands, Skyfire Mountains, The Ruins of Sebilis, The Emerald Jungle, Timorous Deep, and Howling Stones.
- The Plane of Fear and the Plane of Hate now load balance when populated by enough adventurers. Raid targets will only spawn in the base version of the zone.

*** Miscellaneous ***

- If you are currently bound in a zone that no longer allows Bind Affinity to function, that bind point will be reset to your starting location the next time you enter your current bind zone.
- Monk - The skills Eagle Strike and Dragon Punch (or Tail Rake) now share the same timer as Tiger Claw so that they will no longer conflict with the reuse timer for Kick, Round Kick and Flying Kick.
- The auto-follow command no longer requires you to be grouped with your targeted player.
- Corrected a bug that prevented the Add Funds function in the Marketplace window from working.
- Bags and items will no longer temporarily disappear on the client if you retrieve them from the shared bank and have a lore item conflict with your Parcels.


*** UI ***

- In a future release, marketplace purchases will be able to complete directly without having to open the Marketplace window. Created a new window that contains only information about the specific marketplace item to support this.
- Corrected a bug where NPC wild rampage messages were being filtered as pet wild rampage messages and vice versa.


- Changed -

EQUI.xml
EQUI_PurchaseWnd.xml


*** Previously Updated ***

- Trakanon in Sebilis will drop additional Veeshan's Peak key pieces (Trakanon's Tooth) on progression servers.
- a dracoliche in pre-revamp Plane of Fear is no longer teeny tiny. He is three times his previous size, and the same size as his post-revamp version. a dracoliche in pre-revamp Plane of Fear now has a 100% chance to drop an item, up from 30%.
- The experience rewards for all bone chip quests have been retuned. Half of the bone chip quests had their reward increased dramatically. However, with the current ease of collecting bone chips in the modern game, the reward was very high in some cases, and so those quests have had the reward reduced.
- The Keg of Vox Tail Ale is now available for purchase from various merchants across Norrath.
- An Undead Bard will only spawn in the base version of Old Sebilis.

*** Items ***

- Adjusted the weapon damage bonus formula to scale more gracefully for low damage weapons. This should result in damage bonus values that are more in line with the old formula for older items.


*** Spells ***

- Fixed a bug that caused spells with a recourse component to cause triggered spells to hit the caster rather than the caster's target. This is most notable in the case where the wizard claw line of spells would cause effects such as Pyromancy to harm the wizard rather than the wizard's target.
- Bard - Corrected an issue with a number of spells that were not behaving as intended. A notable example of the fix is that Selo's Kick will once again be usable while under the effects of Frenzied Kicks.


*** AA ***

- Beastlord - Made rank 2 of Shrink available to Beastlords.
- Cleric - Bestow Divine Aura has been renamed Bestow Divine Aura Azia and Cascading Divine Aura has been renamed Bestow Divine Aura Beza to simplify the categorization of the abilities.
- Cleric - Adjusted ranks 10-12 of Ward of Purity so that these abilities provide an improvement over rank 9.
- Shaman - Restored the missing rank 2 of Shrink.
- Warrior - Quickened Howl of the Warlord has been fixed to correctly apply its spell haste to all ranks of Howl of the Warlord.
- Warrior - Ranks 2 and 3 of Merciless Blade have been fixed to function on 2-handed slashing weapons. Previously it would only function on 2-handed blunt and 2-handed piercing weapons. Renamed this ability to Merciless Grip to better reflect its ability to increase the damage of all 2-handed weapon types and updated the description.
- Warrior - Corrected a bug with Combatant's Pact that prevented it from having any effect and updated its description. It will now increase the amount of health healed by promised heal triggers.
- Warrior - Updated Hastened Unbroken Attention to also function on the level 102 skill Unflinching Attention.
- Wizard - Changed the way Frenzied and Sustained Devastation consume limited use charges. Charges will now be consumed based on the number of spells cast and not the number of targets hit. This corrects an issue where spells that hit multiple targets would consume as many charges as there were targets hit by the single spell.
- Wizard - Spells that meet the Frenzied and Sustained Devastation focus criteria that are triggered from twincast or from spell triggers (such as the second spell from Ethereal Weave) will consume a limited use charge.
- Wizard - Removed the mana preservation suppression component from all ranks of Frenzied Devastation and Sustained Devastation.


*** Progression Servers ***

- Items introduced with the 2003 revamp of Veeshan's Peak will no longer drop on Progression Servers until Legacy of Ykesha has unlocked.

Source: https://forums.daybreakgames.com/eq/index.php?threads/game-update-notes-nov-18-2015-the-broken-mirror.228194/

A goddess wakes and gazes into a looking glass. The reflection of her true nature fractures and breaks.

Even as the looking glass shatters and the world around her dissolves, Anashti Sul only looks deeper still into the fragments as they drift away. When her fractured mind glimpses her surroundings, she discovers that she is adrift in an unknown time and place where gods and goddesses maintain direct influence over Norrath. A hunger for power wells within her, having passed many an age with no power at all and an upstart sitting in her place. With a whole new realm before her, she resolves to rule again!


*** Highlights ***

- EverQuest's 22nd expansion, "The Broken Mirror" is out now!

*** Highlights ***

- Look to the marketplace this December! From the makers of Cat in the Bag comes Dog in a Crate. Each crate contains a random adoptable dog familiar. Trade them to your friends or collect them all yourself. Nothing evokes the true spirit of Frostfell like the gift of puppies!
- Two new sets of Frostfell-themed Hero's Forge armor are now available! You can find one in the Marketplace, while the other can be acquired by completing certain Frostfell quests.

- Grubbonion's Locked Tower - The Healing Ward can be used to kill Korinth the Crusher even after you've completed the step to kill him. However, you must still be on the task and at least on the step to kill him in order to use the item.
- Grubbonion's Locked Tower - The optional step is truly optional this time. We swear. Healing Ward and Decay Spike items should both work properly whether the optional step is completed or not. Added a small reward for completing this step.

- Reduced the cooldown on the Shard of Healing used in the quest The Lost Lexicon Explorers Expedition.

- Corrected a bug that prevented achievement credit being applied for killing bosses in The Broken Mirror raid zone Plane of Fear.

*** Spells ***

- Modulation and cannibalization spells can no longer be cast if the damage dealt by the spell is greater than your maximum health. This functionality previously only applied to the items Summoned: Modulating Rod and Rod of Mystical Transvergence.

- Removed all achievements related to Bard's Casting Proficiency as they were all redundant with reaching level 10.

- Lord of Ire has returned from his vacation and can be found in the Plane of Hate: Revisited.
- Adjusted how NPCs choose a melee target in relation to player pets:
- - It is now possible for a pet to be the target of an NPC's melee attacks if it has the highest aggro with other players in range.
- - This behavior can be adjusted on a per NPC basis and will currently be disabled for all current and previous raid difficulty NPCs.
- - It is additionally possible for some NPCs to ignore the hatred generated by pets and instead attribute a portion of that hatred toward the owner. This behavior will be in play on raid targets on progression servers.
- Adjusted how NPCs choose a melee target when they are rooted: NPCs will now choose to hit the target that they hate the most that is within melee range. Previously NPCs would simply hit the nearest hated target.


*** AA ***

- Monk - Corrected an issue that caused all three ranks of Thunderfoot to trigger 6% of the time rather than 6, 9, and 12% of the time.
- Updated the description on all ranks of Companion's Wrath to clarify the functionality of the ability.

*** UI ***

- Adjusted the default gamma behavior of the game in windowed mode. By default, opening the game will no longer adjust the brightness of your desktop as it should no longer be necessary to increase the gamma slider in order to achieve reasonable in-game visibility. The option to revert to legacy functionality has been included in the advanced display options window with the button 'Enable Windowed Gamma'.
- Removing a stat mount or illusion from the key ring stat slot will now properly remove it.
