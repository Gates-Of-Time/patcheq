Today's EverQuest game update features the release of Hate Rising, the first extension to the Call of the Forsaken expansion.

Here are the patch notes:

    *** Call of the Forsaken: Hate Rising ***

    - Call of the Forsaken: Hate Rising has been released! As adventurers continue to collect the artifacts that Zebuxoruk says will send Lady Lendiniara back to her world, a familiar face returns to suggest that the Forsaken may not be all that he seems.
    - Seek out new Heroic Adventures in Ethernere-Tainted West Karana, Neriak 4th Gate, and the Bixie Warfront!
    - Discover new raids and missions, each revealing a new aspect of the puzzle surrounding the Ethernere incursion in Norrath.

    *** Highlights ***

    - Heroic Adventures can now be attempted by players level 85 and up. The difficulty (and rewards) will automatically scale based on the highest level player in the Adventure.
    - Increased the level spread for most shared tasks so that any group that can share experience can enter the same task.
    - Increased the experience, coin, and currency rewards for many existing segments of Heroic Adventures based on the actual time players were taking to complete them.
    - Fixed an issue that prevented especially large melee attacks, usually backstabs or flying kicks, from dealing critical damage.

    *** Items ***

    - Increased the stats on all types of Mercenary gear.
    - Mercenary gear is now all/all.
    - The finishing kick from recent monk chest armor has been reduced to a single kick.
    - The Cerebral debuff line of Enchanter robe clicks now properly runs out of charges, and no longer works on spells with no mana cost.
    - The Tears of Alaris can now be converted to and from augment form.
    - The Rallosian Spear Ornamentation has been renamed to Rallosian Greatsword Ornamentation.
    - The Blima Ornament, Kingslayer Ornament, and Warpower Ornament can now be used with hand-to-hand weapons.
    - Yew Leaves found in the Wakening Lands should be easier to spot now.
    - Hero's Sigil of the Council can now be equipped in the ammo slot.
    - Adjusted the effect from the item Rod of Dark Rites so that its use charges are only consumed by spells that cost mana.
    - Removed particle effects from all items and spells that summon mounts.
    - Several items that were tradable on normal servers but not on Firiona Vie have been fixed.

    *** Quests & Events ***

    - Increased the level spread for most shared tasks so that any group that can share experience can enter the same task. Please use /bug to inform us of cases where this is not true.
    - Minimum and maximum level requirements on tasks no longer take the average of the group but instead require that each person meet the requirements.
    - Modified shared task names on those tasks that are split in to multiple level groups to indicate the approximate average level it was built for.
    - - Example: Lavaspinner Hunting [65] versus Lavaspinner Hunting [68+].

    - Sarnak Recovery - Escaped Sarnaks will properly update these quests.
    - The Long Lost Puppet - The Resplendent Rose needed for this task should be easier to spot.
    - Freedom! - Fixed an issue where Grohlok the Tyrant would be immortal if certain conditions were met.
    - Removed the level 99 cap on receiving rewards from 10th Anniversary reward sets.
    - Chamberlain Krystorf, Seneschal Aldikar, and the Dain's Servant Girl will now present you with the Protection of the Dain if you present your Ring of Dain Frostreaver IV to them.
    - The Plane of Sky key previously known as "Veeshan's Key (Key of Misfortune)" that grants access to the quest halls within island 1 has been renamed "Efreeti's Key" and is now saved on your key ring when used.
    - The keys required to progress from island 1 to island 9 in the Plane of Sky are now saved on your key ring when used in order to travel from island to island. You must use each key at least once, in order, before using the next key in order for them to be saved on your key ring.
    - Removed all faction hits to the Inhabitants of Sky faction. If your reputation with this faction is below neutral, it will be reset to neutral upon entering the Plane of Sky.
    - Corrected several issues that could cause Ambersnout to die without leaving a corpse.

    *** Spells ***

    - Cleric - Increased target limits on all AE versions of Reviviscence by roughly 25 percent to account for the presence of invalid targets in the area.

Hotfix for March 18, 2014
------------------------------
Source: https://forums.daybreakgames.com/eq/index.php?threads/hotfix-notes-march-18-2014.209275/
A hotfix was put out to live servers this afternoon:

    *** Hotfix ***

    * The new rare global drops have been disabled in Heroic Adventures and Missions for the time being.
    * Karl Kranigan is a bit more sturdy now. It will no longer be possible to accidentally kill him while working on the 11th anniversary task "Stealing My Life Back."

This means the recently added Rain of Fear raid-equivalent random rare drops recently added to Call of the Forsaken content will no longer drop in instanced zones for the time being. 
Most likely, this is in response to reports of certain NPCs in heroic adventures dropping the items at a much higher rate than intended.

**Highlights**

* The Plane of War is now available! Enter this extremely challenging plane and challenge the Zek brothers to learn their strategic and tactical secrets... but bring strong allies, as only the most skilled (level 95 and above) can hope to survive on an eternal battlefield such as this.

**Items**

* All mounts will now run at the speed of the fastest mount you have used. You may need to re-use your fastest mount in order to teach the others how quickly to run.

**Heroic Characters**

* New Heroic Characters, whether created or upgraded, will now be directed to begin their adventures in Feerrott, the Dream with Investigator Drolmer.

Beware, as this protection will fall away if you venture away from the camp where you start, and will not be reapplied. This protection is not available to upgraded Heroic Characters.
* Characters above level 85 who upgrade to Heroic Characters now get skills added if they were below the caps for level 85 characters.
* Characters who upgrade to Heroic Characters while in the Tutorial zone will now be moved to Feerrott, the Dream automatically.

Height differences between focused and unfocused warders will be less dramatic, but higher level pets should always be larger than smaller level pets.
* Druids - New Zephyrs have been created for each location that previously had both a Ring and a Circle spell. These new scrolls are available in the same locations as the originals.
* Enchanter - Increased the damage absorption caps on all self and targetable runes from level 71 to 100 in order to more closely match NPC damage scaling in that range.
* Enchanter - Increased the duration of Draconic, Polychromatic, Opalescent, Multichromatic, Pearlescent, and Polychromatic Runes to match the durations of later spells in their lines.
* Heroic characters will no longer be automatically granted spells relating to anchors. They will still be available for free when the items are obtained.
* Removed several spells that were mistakenly given to heroic characters but were never released normally. If you have them, they will be level 255 and can safely be removed from your spellbook.

**NPC**

* Alchemist Redsa now properly sells Waterwort in the Plane of Knowledge.
* Ice golems in Frostcrypt once again look icy.

**AA**

**Miscellaneous**

* Rogues can now successfully reduce their aggro by using hide while auto-attack is enabled.
* The client will now exit fullscreen if there is a crash detected so that the prompt will appear above the window (previously it would make it look like the client had frozen).

**UI**

* Increased the number of short duration buff slots from 20 to 30.
* Added a popup window for fast camping in non-combat zones and for general camping.

*Changed*

* CascadeMenu.txt
* EQUI_ShortDurationBuffWindow.xml

**Previously Updated**

* Increased the storage caps for Alternate Advancement points at most levels. The amount of AA points you can store now increases more linearly as you gain levels.
* Investigator Drolmer in the dream version of Feerrott can now more reliably determine whether you are playing as a Heroic Character when you try to accept his quest.
* Heroic character augments are no longer Prestige.
* New items that drop randomly in Call of the Forsaken zones no longer have race restrictions, but no longer drop in Heroic Adventures in order to preserve their intended rarity.
