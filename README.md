Music works on all sound cards. If you still aren't getting music, 
double check to make sure that music is turned on in-game. In addition, 
you may not have correct drivers, and/or you may not have it set 
properly. In any case, either call our tech support or go to the tech 
support area in chat. Please be advised that music DOES have a 
performance impact on the game, although it is a small one.

Frame Rate Speedup - Our resident graphics genius sped up the game a 
fair amount. Those of you in areas like Greater Faydark should see some 
real improvements.

Corpse Bug - We've been tracking a nasty little bug that would make 
corpses disappear. I'm sure many of you know firsthand about this one. 
We finally nailed it and it should be safe to die again ;)

There's a whole bunch of other stuff that has been fixed as well and is 
listed in the patch message.

Just as an FYI we did find a server-side bug that's been fixed and we 
will probably have to down the servers one at a time to update since 
this bug is one that really needs to be fixed.

One final Item: Yes, glide on banshee's is coming back. It should be in 
later this week.

April 29, 1999  News Bit from John Smedley

Here's a summary of what was done in the last 2 days

1) We did a major hardware upgrade to our primary router here in San 
Diego.
2) We worked with CERFnet to do a router upgrade to their facility here 
in San Diego.
3) We moved Karana over to CERFnet
4) We brought up Rodcet Nife

I think you will find now that the packet loss should be basically 
gone... at least on our end. We were definetely causing some of the 
loss before (only when we hit major numbers) but now things are very, 
very clean running and that is with 23,582 people on just as I write 
this (a new record).

Does this mean that EVERYONE'S Packet Loss is gone? Absolutely not. 
BUT, I did some surveys in most of the worlds and about 750f the people 
told me their Packet Loss was great. If you are having problems now, do 
a traceroute to chat.everquest.com and send it to the email address 
traceroute@verant.com and we will take a look. We take our customers 
connections very seriously, and if a whole lot of people on one network 
are having a problem we will do our best to look into it. It doesn't 
mean we can always get the reaction we want (some networks are just 
plain bad) but many times we can help find a legitimate problem and 
help correct it.

report the number of charges remaining after zoning.
- Corpses should remain lootable even if a player goes linkdead while 
looting

spellbook or sit in order to escape the effects of these spells.

screen if another party initiates a trade.
- Non-melee items equipped in weapon slots should no longer mutate if 
the pc is charmed.
- Extremely large NPCs, ie Vox, should not suicide when stuck.

New emotes:
- Here is a list of new emotes that have been added to the game: agree, 
amaze, apologize, applaud, plead, bite, bleed, blink, blush, boggle, 
bonk, bored, brb, burp, bye, cackle, calm, clap, comfort, congratulate,

PVP Changes:
- In order to make PVP combat between spellcasters and melee types more 
viable some changes to PVP spell effects have been made. All damage 
spells cast in PVP combat will do less damage to the PC than the same 
spell would do to an NPC. When a PC is under the effect of a root-type 
spell there is a 20% chance that they will break free when a direct 
damage spell is cast upon them.

Spell Changes:
- Levitate: All players may now cancel this effect.
- Paralyzing Earth now Wizard and Necromancer useable.
- The Mana cost on some Magician damage shields has been slightly 
reduced.
- Alter Plane: Hate and Alter Plane: Sky have been changed into higher 
level spells.
- Succor: Ro (Druid) is now a level 39 spell (previously a typo as a 
level 49 spell.
- Curse of the Simple Mind (Enchanter) now lowers both Int AND Wis.
- Selo`s Consonant Chain (Bard) should now work better.
- Shadow Vortex (Necro) is more effective.
- Screaming Terror is now an all or nothing save. This should stop the 
'train' problems that it was causing.
- Gravity Flux will now research correctly for Wizards.
- Lich and Bond of Death are now researchable for Necromancers check 
your tomes.
- The different types of Words of Collection and Words of Acquisition 
are now more easily identifiable.
- Dead Man Walking (Necromancer) has been renamed Dead Man Floating.
- Ignite Bones (Necromancer) has had the movement component removed.  
This means that it will no longer break root and snare spells, and that 
it will now stack with the darkness line.
- Syvelian`s Anti-Magic Aria (Bard) has been fixed.
- A bug in some of the AoE code has been fixed.  AoE spells will now 
effect more monsters.
- Some Magician Summoned items are now lore items.  Items that have 
turned lore have had other small benefits added to them.
- Dance of the Fireflies (Druid) has been changed from Divination to 
Conjuration.
- Rangers have gained the spell Dance of the Fireflies (level 15)
- High Level Enchanter Illusion spells have had the remainder of their 
effects implemented.
- Magi research components have been added to more monsters throughout 
the world.
- There is a new pet command: /pet taunt and /pet notaunt. Pets default 
to /pet taunt
- The Rods for the Ice Comet quests will now pop much more often.
- Envenomed Breath (Shaman) has had its damage raised slightly.
- Scourge (Necromancer and Shaman) has had its damage raised slightly.
- Enchantment of Light and Enchantment of Brilliance (Enchanter) have 
been replaced by new enchantment spells.  These spells have been added 
to a hidden vendor somewhere in the game.
- New quests for Necromancers to research their pets have been added.

Pets:
- High level pets (44th and 49th lvl spells) do less damage
- Pets will now navigate some outdoor and dungeon areas better

DoT Changes:
- If the monster is in melee with you, there is no change to how a DoT 
spell works.
- If the monster is running away from you (fear, wounded, etc.), there 
is no change to how a DoT spell works.
- If the monster is moving when the damage from the DoT is applied 
(happens every few seconds), it will take 66% of the damage that it 
would have taken.
- DoT spells have all had their duration slightly increased.  If the 
monster moves for 18 seconds during a fight, it will take as much 
damage from the DoT as it would before the patch.  If the monster moves 
for less then 18 seconds during a fight, your DoT will do more damage 
then it would have done before the patch.  If the monster moves more 
then 18 seconds during the fight, it will take less damage then it 
would have before the patch.

.....................................................................

September 22, 1999

Fennin Ro Specific Enhancements

damage (i.e. If a group's combined damage if greater than an individual 
player, the group members will be given the exp. and looting rights).

if need be, incorporate this change on other "live" servers.

change in 'TEST' and will conduct a poll as to whether it positively

new class specific quests to obtain the new armor are now in for each 
class that could wear Rubicite.

the products of a quest.

prior to trading to deceive the other player), items/money may only be

language other than "Common Tongue", if the user's language skill is 
high enough, the language being spoken will be noted preceding the 
text.

- Fufil's Curtailing Chant, Tuyen's Chant of Flame and Tuyen's Chant of 
Frost have all had their effects slightly increased.

(improvement) and the stat buff increased (improvement).  Because of 
this, the spells are no longer permanent. They now have a 15 minute 
duration.  Burnout III has also had its casting cost reduced.
- Illusion: Werewolf attack speed component now works as intended.
- Insipid Weakness will research as intended.

********************************************* 


.....................................................................


------------------------------
December 8, 1999  7:00am
------------------------------

The following general enhancements have been introduced with this 
patch.

- /Pet No Taunt and /pet taunt now works
- Bard Levitation is now working as intended.
- A number of spears are now available to the Shaman class.
- Dazzle and Entrance (enchanter) have had their casting times reduced.

loot is dropped by NPCs.

*Race Enhancements*

Barbarians, Ogres and Trolls may now slam magic mobs when equipped with 
magic shoulders.

- The EverQuest Team


.....................................................................


------------------------------
December 14, 1999
------------------------------

- A revision was made to a bug with Dragons, which was introduced with 
the patch last week.
- The new Necromancer spell, Summon Corpse, is now live and functioning 
as intended.


.....................................................................


------------------------------
December 21, 1999
------------------------------

After a week of thorough testing, the Summon Corpse spell is now 
functioning properly (we promise!), and available on all servers.

- In addition, it is now possible to cast Cancel Magic on non-grouped 
players on the PvP and PvP-teams servers.
- All changes were made on the server-side, therefore no patch is 
required.

From everyone on the EverQuest team, and Verant Interactive, we would 
like to wish all of you safe and happy holidays.

.....................................................................

------------------------------
February 3, 2000  8:00 am
------------------------------

The following changes have been implemented on the live servers:

*Spells*

- Lay On Hands: Enhanced to heal more hitpoints per level.
- Enveloping Roots: Casting time reduced to match Immobilize
- Skin Like Nature: Small Damage Shield added. This will stack with 
other shields.
- Insidious Fever: Casting time reduced.
- Insidious Malady: Casting time Reduced.
- Burnout series: Negative HP component removed to bring it in line 
with the Necromancer's Intensify/Augment death series.

*Songs*

- Syvelian's Anti-magic Aura: Potency increased.
- Shauri's Sonorous Clouding: Now also grants See Invisible. Party 
members can now see each other while under the effect of this song.

Additionally, the following songs have been given a slightly larger 
radius:

- Selo's Accelerando
- Agilmente's Aria of Eagles
- Shauri's Sonorous Clouding
- Tarew's Aquatic Ayre

*PvP-Teams Change*

Customers on the PvP-Teams servers have been plagued by a tactic known 
as "Bind Rushing". Casters would bind themselves in a hostile area or 
dungeon, and attack everyone of an opposing race in the area. Sooner or 
later the caster would die. They would then respawn, memorize a few 
spells, then jump back in to attack their wounded opponents.

As a first step in combating this practice and improving life for those 
on the PvP-Servers, casters will now respawn with zero mana after being 
killed by another player in a duel or open combat.

This code is new for those on Tallon and Vallon Zek. It has been in 
place for some time on Rallos Zek and works very well there.

*The Plane of Sky*

All spells that grant levitation will no longer function in the Plane 
of Sky. This affects spells cast by Wizards, Enchanters, Shamans, 
Druids, Necromancers, and Bards. The Plane of Sky is designed to be 
completed in certain fashion, and the existence of these spells allowed 
the islands to be completed out-of-order.

A teleporter will be placed on the first island in the next patch to 
allow people access to the room below.

- The EverQuest Team

.....................................................................

February 17, 2000  7:00 am
------------------------------

***Announcements***

The City of Paineel, home to the infamous Heretics of Erudin, is now 
available via the Optional Patch. In addition, Erudites may now also be 
Shadowknights in addition to the other classes available to them. All 
Erudite Necromancers, Shadowknights, and Clerics who worship the God of 
Fear, Cazic-Thule, now start in the City of Paineel. As such, if you 
wish to create a character of this type from this point forward, you 
*must* download the Paineel zone-files via the Optional Patch.

Please note that if you downloaded the Paineel zone files recently, you 
must run the Optional Patch again to insure you have the correct 
version of the files.

In related news, all of the entrances to the Qeynos Catacombs have been 
fixed.

Enjoy!

The following changes have been implemented on the live servers:

*Spell Changes*

- The recast delay for many of the Shaman buff-spells have been 
reduced.
- "Reoccurring Amnesia" has had its casting time reduced.
- "Yaulp" and "Augmentation" should now stack.
- "Solidarity of Vision" has had its duration increased.
- The Druid spell, "Skin Like Nature", has been returned to its former 
status due to popular opinion. As such, the damage-shield component has 
been removed and the regeneration component has been re-applied.
- "Sense Magic" has been replaced in all cases by the "True North" 
spell. If you have already inscribed the "Sense Magic" spell, the spell 
icon will now automatically reflect "True North".
- A bug that existed with several damage-shield spells, causing their 
damage to be subtracted rather than added when stacked, has been 
corrected. The spells will now stack properly.
- The "Feign Death" spell, when cast by a Necromancer, will now have a 
fixed duration. The Necromancer will receive several warnings prior to 
the spell wearing off. This change was necessary because some 
Necromancers found a way to gain experience through their pet while 
being AFK for an extended duration, such as being in bed for the night. 
Note: This does not affect Shadowknights or Monks.
- New Necromancer spells are now in game. Check your spell vendors.
- Alchemy has been revamped. Check with your local Shaman.
- DOT (Damage Over Time) spells will no longer hinder camping.

*General Changes/Fixes*

- The dungeon of Paw has again received a minor update to slightly 
reduce the difficulty of the zone.

- All known issues with the SBLive soundcard have been corrected.

- From this point forward, deleting a character will cause all corpses 
belonging to that character to likewise be deleted. This change was 
made primarily to stop a no-drop transfer bug. It also has the added 
effect of cleaning up corpses for characters that people no longer 
intend to play.

- Crippling Blows will now display the correct damage in the "You have 
scored a Crippling Blow (###)" line.

*Corpse Looting Exploit*

Recently, an exploit was discovered that allowed certain unsavory 
individuals to loot the corpses of other players without their consent. 
The precise symptom of this is that the owner would find their corpse 
stripped of everything except for no-drop items, and items in a bag 
with no-drop items. This exploit was fixed in this patch.

If you were affected by this exploit recently, you are entitled to a 
reimbursement of your lost items assuming that we still have a record 
of what you had. Please contact a GM in-game to arrange for an 
investigation.

During the course of the investigation, people who have exploited this 
bug will be subject to disciplinary action by our GM staff up to and 
including item wipes, suspension, and/or banishment.

*Rogue Enhancements*

Rogues received several enhancements as part of this patch:

- The chance to score a critical hit with a throwing weapon has been 
increased significantly.

- When throwing a weapon from behind the NPC in question, a rogue now 
has a chance to score a "Deadly Strike", for enhanced damage above and 
beyond that of a critical hit.

- A new rogue-specific ability has been added to the "Hide" skill. It 
is called "Evade". This skill has the effect of lowering the amount 
that the targeted NPC hates the rogue, and has the potential of making 
the engaged NPC switch to another target (preferably a tank) within the 
rogue's group. It is essentially a "reverse taunt". This ability helps 
mitigate the negative effects of the rogue's exceedingly high damage-
output potential. It also will in-turn help the rogue do even more 
damage as the NPC is much more likely to expose its back. It is engaged 
by targeting the NPC you wish to "Evade" and pressing the "Hide" 
button. As a note, you must not be in combat mode in order to use this 
ability.

*Mistwalker*

The Mistwalker will once again cast its spell as often as it used to 
prior to the last patch. However, the resulting pet will now 
automatically "dissipate" after one combat round. The change that 
reduced the "proc" percentage on the weapon was made due to an 
unintended interaction between the pet and the target when several 
users of this weapon were attacking the same target. Since the new pet 
now automatically dissipates after one round, the reduced "proc" 
percentage was no longer necessary.

*Class-Specific Armor Quests*

Class-Specific armor quests, especially those belonging to Clerics, 
Paladins, and Shadowknights, have been reduced in terms of how long it 
will take the average person to acquire the armor. These classes, and 
others that found particular pieces of their armor exceedingly 
difficult to obtain should find it much easier now.

In addition, a bug that hindered completion of the Bracer of Ro quest 
for some races has been corrected.

*Tallon Zek*

Loot rules for PvP deaths on the PvP-Teams server, Tallon Zek, have 
been changed from "Coin + 1 item" to "Coin Only". This change was made 
to study the impact of loot-rules upon server population in reference 
to the loot/efficiency disparity between caster and melee characters. 
This change is a test, and may or may not be retained or rolled out 
across the other PvP servers, pending the results of the server 
population study over the next few weeks.

*Plane Changes*

Several changes have been implemented in the Planes as part of this 
patch:

- Characters will now lose all enchantments upon entering the Plane of 
Sky.

- Due to the fact that the levitate-series no longer works within the 
Plane of Sky, a teleporter has been placed to allow entrance into the 
quest room.

- A teleporter has been placed within the Plane of Hate in order to 
give non-casters a way out of the zone besides death, potion, or group 
teleport.

*Loot Messages*

Messages indicating what has been looted from a corpse will now be 
broadcast to everyone within the looters group. This change was made 
due to public request and to encourage trust within the group. We may, 
in the future, employ filters to allow people to choose whether or not 
they wish to receive loot messages.

*Fiery Avenger*

The greatly anticipated defining blade of the Paladin, the "Fiery 
Avenger", is again available within game via a quest. The *first* 
devout Paladin to wield this blade and be validated by a GM in-game 
will be publicly congratulated within a patch message and on the 
Official EverQuest web-site at www.everquest.com.

- The EverQuest Team


.....................................................................


------------------------------
February 23, 2000
------------------------------

Today's patch was primarily comprised of server-side changes in 
preparation for the release of EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark. Only one 
gameplay-affecting issue was updated as a result of this patch: 

- Being killed by another player in a duel will now cause you to re-
spawn with zero mana. 

This change was implemented to counter a strategy used by casters where 
they would duel to reduce downtime between fights, thus allowing groups 
to engage creatures that they normally would not be able to. 

- The EverQuest Team


.....................................................................


------------------------------
March 29, 2000
------------------------------

This morning's update consisted primarily of server-side changes to 
improve performance of the game engine in general. No items, spawns, 
spells (with the exceptions below), etc., were changed as a result of 
this patch.

Area Effect "Fear" spells will no longer work in PvP. This affects a 
bard song, as well as the Cleric "Wave of Fear" spell. 

Corrected a bug with some of the Resurrection spells that caused them 
to return too little experience.

We plan on publishing data and item changes next week if all goes well 
on the Test server. We apologize to those who are inconvenienced by 
having to wait for the expected changes.

***Patch Day***

The following is a list of changes that were implemented on the Live 
EverQuest servers today:

*Spells*
- You will now receive a message when attempting to mesmerize a 
creature that is immune to that type of spell.
- You can now right-click-and-hold on bard songs to determine what 
instrument skill is used by the spell.
- Dyn's Dizzying Draught has had its casting time lowered 
significantly.
- Corrected a bug in the Druid root + damage spells (Enveloping roots 
series) that caused the spell's damage to have a chance of breaking the 
spell. They work much better now.
- The Magicians Phantom Armor series now grants HP regeneration.
- The Druid spell, dance of the fireflies, has been changed from 
"Outdoor only" to "Night only". It may now be cast in dungeons.
- Corrected a typographical error that allowed high level magicians to 
inscribe the Malosi spell. It was not intended for magicians under 
level 50.

*General Changes/Fixes*
- Items have gained the ability to be restricted by Deity. If a deity 
restriction is placed upon an item, it will show when you right-click-
and-hold on the item.
- The AC on the mid-level cleric quest armor has been increased.
- The Terror Mask will now cast "Fear" instead of "Call of Bones" as 
previously announced. The "Call of Bones" effect was placed on this 
item by mistake.
- The Mempo of Likato now grants AC.
- The Quest for the Short Sword of Morin has been fixed.
- Some spawn-time problems in Mistmoore have been repaired.
- Five spawn-time problems were identified in regards to the Armor of 
Ro (Paladin) quests. They have been fixed and Paladins should have a 
much easier time of obtaining their armor.
- Pets should now attack Willowisps on command.
- Many spell-gems and icons have been changed to reflect the 
appropriate action of the spell. Be sure to reacquaint yourself with 
your spell line-up.
- Fixed a bug that caused targetable bard songs to ignore the 
instrument in use.

*Kerra Ridge*
Kerra Ridge has been completely revamped. The target level-range for 
the zone has been slightly increased. In addition, many new quests have 
been added to the zone. The faction for Kerrans has been changed so 
that those who killed them indiscriminately before today's update can 
take part. Be warned that the Kerrans still do not like everyone.

*Paw*
Paw has received another minor difficulty adjustment. In addition, item 
drop percentages have been increased.

*The Plane of Hate*
The Plane of Hate has received an item-drop/spawn-time revamp. Take 
care in your exploration of this zone as many things have changed.

EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark (upgrade) should now be arriving on 
doorsteps around the world. Please note that attempting to create an 
Iksar character will not work until the expansion zones are officially 
opened within the next week.

We ask that if you attempt to create an Iksar character out of 
curiosity that you do not proceed past the "History" page (the page 
that speaks of your lifestyle) in the character creation process. Once 
at this page, please use the "Back" button to get back to the character 
creation screen. Pressing "Next" on this screen will cause the name you 
have selected to go into the "used name" list, making it unavailable 
for future use.

We appreciate your cooperation.

- The EverQuest Team

*Today's Patch*

Today's patch consisted of preparations for the launch of Kunark, as 
well as some new art. The following spell changes were also included:

- Corrected a bug with a new bard song that allowed them to charm 
anything, such as deities and dragons.
- Added a lesser included wisdom effect with "Brilliance" as well as a 
lesser included intelligence effect with "Insight". These spells will 
no longer stack.

------------------------------

As part of the emergency update completed last night, a change was 
implemented that increases the amount of damage done by someone 
wielding a 2 handed weapon. 

This change was made due to a statistical imbalance in the way that 
damage is calculated at the mid-to-upper levels. A person wielding a 
one-handed weapon of a given ratio was able to do more damage than when 
wielding a two-handed weapon of the same ratio. 

We would like to stress that no change has been made to the amount of 
damage done by people wielding one-handed weapons. The net result of 
this change is that people choosing to wield two-handed weapons will 
now do more damage than they did before.

Greetings everyone! 

This morning's update is one of the final updates necessary for the 
EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark launch scheduled to take place on 
Monday. 

As part of this update, a new EverQuest Patch Program was sent to your 
system. For those who have installed the Ruins of Kunark, this update 
has added a button labeled "K-Patch" to the patch program control 
panel. Within these patch messages, Ruins of Kunark players may be 
asked from time to time to press the "K-Patch" button following the 
download of the regular patch. This will allow them to download Kunark-
related updates when they are required. 

If you have not installed EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark, you will not 
see a "K-Patch" button. 

In addition to the Kunark-related changes made today, a bug that 
lowered the maximum damage of two-handed weapons that was introduced 
earlier this week in the Emergency Update was also corrected. Finally, 
the art update yesterday implemented a solution that we've been 
promising: Male barbarians can now see their shields.

We continue to appreciate everyone's patience while we get the servers 
ready for Kunark. 

Thank you.

- The EverQuest Team

Hello All,

Due to the unfortunate problems we have had with our order processing 
system, it doesn't look like every person that ordered Kunark will 
receive it in a timely fashion. We sincerely apologize for this 
unanticipated problem. We expect that roughly 90% of the people who 
ordered will be receiving their orders by today.

Because of the problems we have had we will be refunding anyone who 
ordered Ruins of Kunark on or before Wednesday April 19th and does not 
receive their orders by today for their shipping costs, as well as 
crediting their accounts for one month of gameplay. This applies to 
International orders as well.

We'll be taking care of these refunds via email at 
kunarkrefund@verant.com, and it will be necessary for anyone that wants 
to take advantage of this refund to send us your Station Name, billing 
name and address on the account and the date you placed the order. 
Please also include "Kunark Refund" in the subject line.

We are very sorry for the problems that have come up.

The EverQuest Team

Hello all,

I wasn't able to get this in the patch message this evening, but I'd 
hope you'd help spread it around. I'm also having new /MOTD's put on 
the servers to be sure that people get the word.

/movelog registered accounts from Veeshan and Bristlebane will be 
moving to Saryrn, Xegony and Bertox to The Seventh Hammer.

I'd like to remind everything that corpses will not follow the account, 
so everyone will want to make sure that there corpses are looted, or 
they will be lost. I'd also like to note that more people requested the 
move than we will be able to accommodate, and we appreciate everyone's 
understanding in this matter.

-Gordon

***Patch Day***

*General Changes*

- Sounds have been updated for NPCs in Kunark. Your Iksar should no 
longer sound like humans.
- Dark Elven worshipers of Solusek Ro and Bristlebane will no longer be 
natively KOS to the outpost in the Overthere. Take care that if you 
have taken actions allowing you to be judged sufficiently by your 
deeds, you may still find yourself KOS.
- Increased the number of frightfingers in the Plane of Fear. 
Previously only 3 frightfingers would pop per respawn. 
- Several problems with the guards that were buffed up last week have 
been addressed. Some guards that should not have been buffed have been 
fixed. In addition, due to the level of the new guards, they all gained 
the ability to innately see-invisible. The level of those guards has 
been reduced so that they no longer automatically get this ability, 
making it a bit easier to sneak by them.
- Many quests have been updated and/or fixed, both in terms of ease of 
completion and reward.

*Item Updates*

- Corrected a typo that had the Canyoneer's Pike marked as NO RENT, 
causing it to disappear on logout.
- Corrected the model for the Axe of the Iron Back. It was showing as a 
2H sword when equipped.
- The Halcyon Broadsword was mistakenly marked as an artifact. This has 
been corrected.
- Corrected item icons for various pieces of Burynai Hide Armor. It was 
displaying improperly in the inventory slots.
- The Skull Mask of Innervation has been changed so that it must be 
worn to activate its effect.
- Corrected a problem with the Scourgetail Whip whereby the damage and 
delay figures were transposed yielding a 30 damage, 5 delay weapon. 
- The "Illusion: Iksar" spell scroll is now droppable/tradeable.
- The Goblin Eye Poker now looks like a dagger instead of a small sack.
- The Cone of Mystics, which incidentally also looked like a small 
sack, now looks as intended.
- Corrected a typo that had the Goblin Skull Crusher's effect set to 
the "Lull" spell, which is not appropriate for a melee weapon. The 
"Lull" effect has been replaced with an appropriate effect.
- The Pouch of Mistletoe Powder will now impart its effect on the 
targeted character.
- Mosquito Wings are available in game once again.
- Many items had incorrect usage restrictions, and have been repaired.

As always, we strive to avoid making negative changes to items that 
already exist in game. However, there are cases where a particularly 
unbalancing error has been made, such as with the Scourgetail Whip 
mentioned above, where the item in question must be fixed in interest 
of maintaining game balance. 

We will continue to repair problems, add content, and enhance gameplay 
in both Kunark and EQ proper. We appreciate everyone's support.

Thank you,

The EverQuest Team

May 25, 2000  8:00 am
------------------------------

*Patch Day*

Greetings all! The following changes have been implemented on the Live 
servers:

*Spells/Songs*

- Voltaic Draught, a high level wizard direct damage spell was 
improperly saving versus resistance to cold. It now appropriately saves 
versus magic.
- The higher level bard song by Brusco was improperly healing the 
target instead of damaging it. This has been corrected.

*Items*

The Shadowknight class-specific quest armor, Darkforge armor, has had 
its weight decreased substantially.

The Runed Fighter's Staff, previously useable by Monks and Warriors, 
has been restricted to Monks only. The statistics on this staff are 
much more powerful than normally allowed for warriors. This change is 
retroactive and will be reflected on items currently in inventory. 
Though we strive to avoid negatively adjusting items after they have 
been earned, this item presented a balance issue, making the change 
necessary. We apologize to warriors that currently own this weapon.

A data error with the Symphonic Saber, causing it to report "Item out 
of charges", has been corrected. Due to the dynamics of this particular 
issue, current owners will need to contact a GM to trade this item out 
for a new, properly working version of the item.

The Burning Rapier (rogue weapon) has been enhanced. In addition to an 
increase in statistics, it received a stronger spell effect. The 
lightsource effect on the weapon has been removed due to an aesthetic 
rogue desire to be "sneaky" :)

The effect on the Hangman's Noose will now work properly.

*General Changes*

- Some NPCs in Dalnir were casting spells much too powerful for their 
level. They have been adjusted.
- Pathing information has been updated in Highkeep. NPCs and pets 
should have a much easier time of navigating the zone.
- Some Quest-NPCs were not spawning properly in Rathe Mountains. These 
issues have been corrected.
- A handful of problems reported with research practice via the 
Concordance of Research have been corrected. All practice-rune recipes 
should now work correctly.
- Gorilla's in Burning Wood now have a new texture set that properly 
reflects their undead status.
- Fishing should now work properly in Kunark zones.
- /yell now reports the proper direction to people hearing the yell.
- Corrected a bug that gave some races the impression that they were 
allowed to start their character in Cabalis. They were never actually 
allowed to create the character there, however the indication that they 
could has been fixed.
- Corrected sound issues that were causing some crashes to the desktop 
in certain cases.

We are in the process of patching music files (*.XMI) for zones in 
which music does not currently work. There are 55 small files (around 
2K each) that will be patched over the next couple of days to enable 
music in all of the affected zones. 

The zone of Timorous Deep has been tuned and itemized. Certain aspects 
of the changes have made certain areas of the zone more dangerous, but 
the reward should be well worth the risk. Feel free to visit this zone 
and search out its treasures at your leisure. Note: These changes went 
in on Monday.

Upon investigation, we discovered a deficiency with the amount of 
experience being rewarded in many Kunark zones (mostly dungeons). The 
affected zones have been updated, and adventurers should notice the 
greater experience reward in return for the increased risk and 
challenge associated with these zones.

June 6, 2000  8:00 am
------------------------------

*Patch Day*

Greetings! The live servers have been updated to reflect the newest 
data on the Test Server:

*General*

- Some new spells are available for the hybrid classes. Check your 
Kunark spell vendors.
- Found and corrected a problem causing people to fall to their deaths 
upon zoning. The majority of these issues should no longer occur.
- Corrected outstanding issues with several quests, including the Brain 
Bite, Shackle of Rock, and the Barnal Flamehands quest.
- Increased treasure in many Kunark zones including The Emerald Jungle, 
Sebilis, and the Frontier Mountains.
- Upon review we've increased the drop-rate of level 51+ spells in 
Kunark. They should be more plentiful now. 
- Updated pathing information in many zones, making it easier for pets 
and other NPCs to get around the zones.

*Items*

- A problem with the spell effect for the Luminary Two-Handed Sword. 
Current owners of this weapon will need to contact a GM to trade their 
sword out for a working one.
- The Gunthak Harpoon is now rentable. It will remain in your 
possession when you leave the game.
- A couple pieces of Blood Ember armor have been reduced in weight.
- Reduced the weight on several Monk weapons found in Kunark.

*PvP Teams Servers (VZ/TZ) and Illusions*

Due to an outstanding bug that allowed a player to permanently 
mesmerize or stun opposing team members when coupled with an illusion, 
illusions will now automatically cancel when the person wearing the 
illusion casts an offensive spell upon any player-character. Players 
should keep this in mind before attacking with spells in an area where 
their faction standing is less than desirable. 

Illusions are defined as any spell that makes a character look 
different than they actually are. This includes all racial illusions, 
as well as other illusions such as Treeform, Wolfform, and the Call of 
Bones series. 

*Risk and Reward*

The concept of risk and reward is very important to the game of 
EverQuest. Ideally, situations that provide a greater reward should 
also provide substantial risk. Over the past several weeks, we've been 
identifying areas in game where risk and reward are at a disparity, and 
making necessary adjustments. 

In most cases, those adjustments are in favor of increasing the reward 
for a specific action. For example, we recently increased the 
experience awarded in many Kunark zones to offset the sometimes-
considerable risk associated with adventuring there. We also do this 
quite frequently by increasing the reward associated with a quest by 
enhancing the item, as we did last week with the Burning Rapier quest. 

However, in some cases there are instances where reward is far in 
excess of the risk involved, and we will be correcting these issues 
like those above as we come across them. For example, there are many 
cases where a solitary and stationary outdoor creature has a "fast 
spawn", yielding the reward of fast experience-gain without the 
commensurate risk. 

Though it is not our policy to announce changes to individual NPCs, we 
did want to let you know that you will see risk/reward disparities 
corrected over the next several weeks.

*PvP Teams (VZ/TZ) Character Transfers*

As many people playing upon the PvP-Teams servers are aware, Vallon Zek 
and Tallon Zek have different rules regarding looting rights from PvP 
combat. Vallon Zek allows the victor to loot all coin plus one item 
from the fallen, whereas Tallon Zek allows only coin-loot with no right to loot items.

Due to the fact that the looting rules were changed on Tallon Zek post-
production, we've decided to allow characters on both servers a one-
time character-move. Registration for the move will open at 6:00pm PDT 
on Friday, June 9th, 2000, on both servers, and will be open through 
12:00pm PDT on Monday, June 12th, 2000. You can register for the move 
by executing the "/movelog yes" command during the registration window. 
There is no limit to the number of people that we will allow to move 
between Tallon and Vallon Zek, so there is no reason to rush to enter 
the command.

Please remember that once you register for the move, your decision can 
not be rescinded. The actual character-move will take place sometime 
next week, at a time to be announced later. Please keep in mind that 
corpses are not moved in a character-move, so we'd recommend against 
leaving unclaimed corpses around after Monday of next week if you've 
asked to be moved. 

Questions about the move process will be addressed in the Gameplay 
Message Forum available via www.everquest.com.


- The EverQuest Team

Updates Not Included in This Patch Message:

* Banshee Aura has had its duration increased.
* Scale of Wolf and Spirit of Scale will no longer be canceled by being 
the target of a melee attack. Ranged attacks and spells will still 
cancel the spell.
* Shaman can now cast Charm Animal
* Some enchanter and shaman spells have had their casting times/mana 
costs altered.
* Augment, Glamour of Kintaz, Rapture, and Clarity II have had their 
mana cost lowered.
* Root spells that cause damage (Druid roots, Hungry Earth) now work 
properly.

*Patch Day*

Hello everyone,

Over the past few weeks, a portion of the EQ team has been working on
The Hole, in preparation of its release in the near future. Even so, a
number of changes and additions were made in today's patch. Most of the
changes are in regards to quests:

- The "Fleshy Orb" quest has been completed
- We've received word that "Fabian" has been spotted somewhere on
Norrath.
- Froglok Foragers and Hunters should been seen more regularly.
- Lord Grimrot should be seen more frequently.
- Skill in tailoring is no longer required to craft The Robe of the 
Lost Circle.

A few items have also been changed this week:

- The Robe of the Lost Circle has been enhanced.
- The Staff of Temperate Flux and the Rod of Insidious Glamour now have
a short casting time associated with their activatable effect (See
Below).
- The Gunthak Harpoon is again NORENT, meaning that it will disappear
when you log off (See Below.)


*Casting Times on Staff and Rod*

We received word a few weeks ago that some people were using these 
items to "spam" other players with their spell-effect messages, causing 
them to disconnect. Though /ignore will allow you to filter out text
messages caused by people on your /ignore list, it will not allow you 
to filter out spell-effect messages for spells cast upon you.

The short casting time should prevent the problems associated with the
targetable and activatable effect on these weapons, however you will
have to stand still to use them now.

*Gunthak Harpoon*

In the last item patch, we made the mistake of making this weapon
"rentable", meaning that it does not disappear upon logoff. Basically,
one of our game designers heard that the weapon was NORENT, concluded
that it must be a bug, and took the initiative to fix it.
Unfortunately, the stats on this weapon, despite its disadvantages of
weight and its non-magical composition, make it much too powerful for
its location and difficulty in obtaining it.

For these reasons, the weapon is once again NORENT, and will disappear
the next time that you log out. This is a retroactive change and will
affect weapons already in possession. We do apologize to those who
acquired it within the last week expecting that it would be a permanent
weapon.

*Chat / Login Process*

The Chat and Login server components are now completely separate,
meaning that players will no longer have difficulty logging in due to 
an excess of people in the chat server.

***Today's Updates***

*The Hole*

We are pleased to announce the opening of The Hole, a high-level 
dungeon on the continent of Odus. The Hole is a complementary addition 
to EverQuest, available to all subscribers regardless of their Kunark 
status. The files necessary to enter The Hole are available via the 
"Optional Patch" button at the bottom of the patch program interface. 
The files are quite large (about 9MB total), so if the download is 
going slowly, you may want to postpone downloading the files until 
later.

As mentioned above, The Hole is a high-level dungeon, designed to 
support characters starting at about level 40. It should be regarded as 
extremely dangerous. As a note, jumping in The Hole from Paineel is NO 
LONGER A SHORTCUT TO TOXXULIA FOREST. The GMs will not recover corpses 
for people who fall, or jump, or attempt to levitate into The Hole. 

*Vallon Zek is now Coin-Only*

As we announced earlier this week, due to the number of people 
specifying interest in "coin-only" loot on Vallon Zek, versus those 
wishing to retain item- loot, we have implemented "coin-only" looting 
rules for PvP combat on Vallon Zek.

*Resurrection*

Previously, players had to be resurrected within two hours after death 
in order to receive any experience back as part of the resurrection. 
Due to the increased size and difficulty associated with Kunark zones, 
we've raised this limit from two hours to three. This should assist 
players and make it easier for them to obtain an experience-returning 
resurrection within the time limit.

*Warping*

We put in some code that should help decrease the "ghosting" (NPCs 
appearing to be some place they aren't) being reported in some of the 
larger Kunark zones. Please let us know how this goes.

*Locked Doors*

We noticed few weeks ago that it is common practice to use NPCs to open 
locked doors rather than by using the services of someone that is able 
to pick locks. In order to protect and increase the value of the 
abilities of the lock-picking classes, NPCs have gained the ability to 
walk through locked doors without opening them. 

*Vox and Nagafen*

Over the past couple of weeks, we've received more and more reports of 
these dragons being bested by smaller and smaller groups of higher-
level (high 50s) adventurers. As we've always felt that Dragons should 
be special encounters that require a large number of people, we were 
left with some choices.

One choice available to us was to increase the power of the dragons to 
a level where the level 60 folks would find them challenging. This 
would have the disadvantage of forever placing them out-of-reach for 
those who did not buy Kunark, and place them further out-of-reach for 
those who did, but are just now approaching the levels where they could 
go on Dragon raids. Another possible solution was to make the dragons 
flee (depop) when engaged by a more powerful group of people. This 
would have the undesired effect of allowing some people to deny others 
the experience of fighting a dragon.

Instead of raising the bar as mentioned above, we've instead decided 
that dragons, or at least these two dragons, should have the magical 
ability to pick their own fights. Players of level 53 or above will now 
encounter some difficulty when attempting to assist in combat with 
these dragons. This should help 40s and low 50-level characters with 
their chances to encounter a dragon without worry of getting forced out 
by much higher level players. In addition, it also has the added effect 
of creating a natural progression from the younger dragons of Antonica 
to the elder and more formidable dragons of Kunark.

a few enhancements:

the class listing since Bards do not have the Archery Skill.
- Removed excess classes listed on the "Silk Lined Steel Helm".
- Fixed the effect on the "Theurgist Mace". Current owners of this item 
will need to trade it out with a GM in game.

*Karana Secondary Split*

Hello all,

In light of our plans to further balance prime-time population on the 
servers, we're going to allow another group of players from Karana to 
split off to Terris-Thule. 

This Friday we will again open /movelog registration on Karana sometime 
around 7pm PDT (GMT-8). The GMs will broadcast when registration is 
open, and we will continue taking /movelog requests for 24 hours. 
Players wishing to have their characters moved to the new split server 
will need to run the command "/movelog yes" after registration is 
opened. As we have identified a minor problem with the hundreds of 
simultaneous uses of the /movelog command, it is recommended that you 
wait a few minutes after registration is opened using it.

Notes:

- /movelog only needs to be run from ONE character, and will count for 
all characters on that server on that account. 
- Players who have requested a move should make sure all of their 
corpses are looted by the time the server is brought down the following 
Tuesday morning. Corpses will not be duplicated in the new world, and 
anything left on a corpse left behind by anyone who moves will be lost.
- We may or may not be able to move everyone who requests this action, 
based upon the number of total requests that we receive. 
- The GM/Guide staff will not be able to tell you whether or not you 
have been selected until after the move is actually completed.
- Karana and Terris-Thule will be down for several additional hours on 
Tuesday, the day of the next patch. Updates will be given at that time.

***Patch Day***

*Miscellaneous Changes/Fixes*

- The "Safe Points" have been moved in Field of Bone and Lake of Ill 
Omen to someplace "safer".
- You can no longer cast invisibility on any pet. 
- Foul language issued through /emote will now be handled by the 
profanity filter.
- Corrected a bug that allowed linkdead players to walk through locked 
doors.
- Rangers above level 50 will now do double damage with Archery against 
non-moving, non-rooted targets. These restrictions allowed us to 
enhance archery without creating a new kiting problem.
- Corrected a bug that had rangers doing less melee damage than was 
intended except when fighting an NPC who was also a ranger.
- Pets, both PC and NPC, will no longer cast "Gate".
- A large rat says, "Hit by non-melee for XXX damage", is history. The 
new message given probably isn't the source of never-ending humor that 
the old one was.
- Updated pathing information in Innothule Swamp.
- Corrected many, many, MANY spelling and grammar errors in the world. 
- Fixed a large number of spell gems and spellbook icons. Take care to 
take a look at your spell lineup to familiarize yourself with the new 
gems/icons.

*Poison*

- Implemented the high level Rogue poisons (level 51+).
- Increased Rogue "Make Poison" skill cap.
- Substantially reduced chance to fail "Apply Poison".
- Rogues will now automatically sit when right-clicking on a poison.
- Failure to make a poison will now return the vial.

*General Crafts*

- The Ant's Potion may now be used anywhere.
- The small and large reinforced wristband may now be crafted.
- The small and medium studded shoulderpads, cloak, and belt may now be 
crafted.
- The medium reinforced mask may now be crafted.
- Sealed Poison Vials can now be crafted.
- The Thermal Cloak may now be tinkered.
- The "This item is trivial..." message in craft skills has been 
replaced with "You can no longer advance in skill from making this 
item". 

*Items*

- The Elven Paladin Newbie Tunic may now be worn by Half Elf paladins.
- The Murky Vial will now properly affect the target instead of the 
player.
- Increased stats on many Plane of Sky items.
- There was evidently more than one "Fine Steel Dagger" running around 
in the world. Some of them have been renamed "Serpant's Tooth".
- The effect on the Staff of Undead Legions has been changed to 
something a bit more useful.
- The Deepwater Helm now has a significant casting time. The function 
of its spell allowed a mana-free heal even though it was intended to be 
a buff.


*/consent*

Some people were spamming others with /consent, causing them to 
disconnect. As a result, /consent can now only be done once every two 
seconds. Should you be harassed via this tool, please use /report. 
Also, please take care to avoid accidentally /consenting someone, as it 
will be two seconds before you can undo it.

*Cazic-Thule and the Feerrott*

There has been a significant change to the factions in the Feerrott and 
Cazic-Thule. Take care not to get killed by NPCs that previously left 
you alone. The significant upside to this change is that the "Cazic 
Gate/Portal" can be made much safer in nature for those who work on 
their faction.

*Regen Effects*

This week we corrected a bug that caused regen-type spells (e.g. 
Regeneration, Chloroplast, Regrowth, etc.) to overwrite DOT spells. As 
a result of this fix, players can no longer accept a regeneration spell 
while under the effect of a DOT. However, if the regen spell is already 
in place, the DOT will stack, but not replace the regen spell. This 
will allow users of beneficial DOTs, such as Call of Bones, to continue 
using their DOT while under the affect of regen.

*Keyed Dungeons*

The key for Charasis (Howling Stones) is now NODROP per the patch 
message from a couple of weeks ago. Furthermore, when your character 
dies, keys for Charasis, Sebilis, and Veeshan's Peak, will no longer 
remain with your corpse, but will instead return with your character to 
its bind point. We made this change to reduce the difficulty and 
corpse-loss potential of these zones, and eliminate the need to do the 
key quests multiple times.

*Barbed Scale Whip*

In the last item patch, this item was changed from its original stats 
to something inferior, as the game designer was not aware that it was 
already in-game. It has been changed back to its original stats.

*Hiding Corpses*

A new command has been implemented in the EverQuest client. This 
command (/hidecorpses) allows players to suppress the display of player 
and NPC corpses on the screen. This can be very useful once you've 
entered a zone with a large number of corpes, causing framerate to 
decay. It will be particularly useful in the planes. The command 
supports the following arguments:

- ALL: Hides all corpses except yours.
- ALLBUTGROUP: Hides all corpses except yours and those of people in 
your group.
- NONE: No longer hides corpses.

For community reasons, this option must be set after entering each 
zone, and will not affect corpses made after you enter the zone. You 
can reset it while in the zone in order to suppress display of corpses 
made since you originally set it. 

*Resurrection*

The resurrection confirmation box will now report the name of the 
person casting the spell as well as what spell they are casting. 
Furthermore, experience will not be "removed" from your corpse until 
you accept the resurrection by choosing YES. Previously, any 
resurrection spell, if declined, would cause the experience to be 
unrecoverable.

*Chat and Login*

Today's patch contains some new features for the EverQuest chat and 
login servers. In addition, it enables support for some international 
keyboard layouts. 

- Tab again switches between fields in login and registration.
- #time will display a time/date stamp.
- #reply will send a private message to the last person to message you.
- Tab will cycle through the last few people to send you a private 
message.
- Rooms may now be closed by staff members. These rooms are in gray, 
and no one will be able to enter them until a staff member opens them. 
Attempting to enter a closed room will display a message.
- EverQuest, including Chat and Login, now supports some international 
keyboard layouts. Information can be found at 
http://everquest.station.sony.com/s_keyboard.html.

August 1, 2000
------------------------------

Greetings everyone! 

Today's patch contains some changes that we are sure everyone will 
enjoy:

- Canned emotes (e.g. /point) now work on NPCs. In addition, the range 
for canned emotes has been increased.
- /who all "guildname" should now work for players who have /roleplay 
turned on.
- Preferences for the mouselook will be saved in your options file. 
Those who turn mouselook off each time when starting EQ will only have 
to do it once more.
- The "Chat Filter" tab in "Options" now has an option to filter 
messages caused by damage shields hitting others.

*Fast Drop*

Our most exciting change today is an option that allows players to 
avoid accidentally dropping items on the ground. The new client allows 
players to set "Item Dropping" preferences on the "General" options 
tab. The three options that can be set are:

- FAST DROP: Items are dropped without confirmation.
- CONFIRM: A confirmation box will be displayed whenever you try to 
drop an item.
- NEVER: You are not allowed to drop items on the ground. 

Alternatively, you can also set these options using the /fastdrop 
command. The arguments are:

- ON: Same as option "Fast Drop" on the General Tab.
- OFF: Same as option "Confirm" on the General Tab.
- NEVER: Same as above.

Please note that whatever your setting, coin will always be dropped 
without confirmation. Additionally, the FastDrop option only applies to 
items being dropped upon the ground. Handing items to NPCs will still 
work regardless of your FastDrop setting.

It is highly recommended that you use option "CONFIRM", as GMs will not 
reimburse any items that are accidentally dropped.

***Character Purge***

Time has come to do some cleanup on character data across the servers. 
On August 23rd (Pacific), we will be doing a system-wide cleanup of 
level 1 characters. All level 1 characters that have not been played 
within 30 days from the date of the purge will be deleted. As GMs will 
not be able to restore any characters that are deleted, please be 
certain to log in any level 1 characters that you wish to keep prior to 
the purge.

- The EverQuest Team

August 9th, 7:00am 
------------------

*Guide Application*

The Guide Application is now back up at http://guideapp.everquest.com. 
If you are over 18 years of age, have a good customer-oriented 
attitude, enjoy helping your fellow player, and are interested in 
joining the Guide Program, we will be pleased to review your 
application.

*Kunark Users*

A new file, emeraldjungle_chr.s3d, is included as part of today's 
patch. This patch adds additional displayable NPCs to the Emerald 
Jungle. Please run the "Kunark Patch" by pressing the "Kunark Patch" 
button on the bottom of the patch program UI prior to entering 
EverQuest.

*Patch Day*

Greetings everyone! Today's patch contains some exciting new changes. 

*General Enhancements*

- Text messages that wrap will be indented on subsequent lines. This 
means that if a person or NPC says something that is more than one line 
long, all subsequent lines will be indented a few spaces. This should 
make it a lot easier to pick out separate messages.
- The spells "United Resolve" and "Heroic Bond" had their levels 
transposed accidentally. Rather than putting them back as intended, 
United Resolve has been changed to Heroic Bond, which means you might 
have two copies of that spell in your spellbook. Feel free to move one 
to the back. Clerics get a new group spell at 58 to compensate.
- The Wurmslayer is now a one-handed slashing weapon.
- The /help command will now list all /-commands available to you.
- Rangers, Paladins, and SKs now have mana equivalent to that of a pure 
caster with the same stats. This will give those hybrids a good deal 
more mana, regardless of their stats. 
- NORENT items, items that disappear when you log out, will now show a 
"NORENT" tag when inspecting the item.
- Most summoned items now have the word "summoned" in their name.

*Changes/Fixes*

- Small Studded Tunic recipe now works
- Scaler recipe now works
- High Elves can now use the Moss Covered Twig and Branch
- Iksar can now wear the Crescent headband.
- The Shintl Lowbrew quest will now work
- The Rusty Rapier now looks like a rapier.
- Elven Wine can now be brewed
- Some pelt-dropping animals were always dropping ruined pelts, rather 
than pelts of quality. This has been repaired.
- The Guild-invite toggle in display options will now work.
- The faction problems with the Charasis Key Quest have been resolved.
- Many pathing errors have been repaired.
- Repaired a bug that caused some anomalies after being charmed or 
feared.
- Repaired a bug that kept the Unswerving Hammer of Faith and Flaming 
Sword of Xuzl from disappearing.

*Dragons?*

Rumor has it that some new dragons have been spotted in Kunark. It 
should be noted however that the dragons can be engaged from much 
further away than is intended. Rather than hold off implementing these 
dragons for another week, we've decided to implement them now and fix 
the problem in the next patch. Enjoy :)

*New Command For Tracking*

New option for those with tracking: /trackplayers. The command will 
work for all players with the tracking skill. The command has two 
settings:

- ON: Default setting, same as it is now. Players will show up in the 
tracking window. 
- OFF: Players will not show up in the tracking window.

*Client Customizations*

Upon starting EverQuest, a new file (EQCLIENT.INI) will be created in 
your EverQuest directory. This file contains customizable settings for:

- Colors for text messages in the in-game chat window 
- Default screen viewing mode 
- Default travel speed (run or walk)

The documentation will be included in the online manual in your 
EverQuest directory once the design is finalized over the next several 
weeks, but the working document is posted below. We felt that people 
would rather have access to the customizations right away while we're 
in the process of building them. 

Modifying this file is optional.

*EQCLIENT.INI documentation*

The [TextColors] section contains entries for various text colors in 
the client. All colors are to be set with Red, Green, and Blue values, 
in decimal. Valid settings for each color range between 0 and 255. 
"Black" (0 red, 0 green, and 0 blue) will be white in overlay mode, and 
black in normal mode.

Here is a list of user colors to use as a guide when editing the file: 

1 - Say 
2 - Tell

login/chat frontend. The following changes have been implemented:

- #help now accepts arguments. #help #command will return help for the 
requested command.
- Errors issued within the chat/login server frontend now display an 
"Error Number". Please have this error number ready when requesting 
technical assistance.

- Corrected a bug that caused items that ran out of charges to 
"disappear" when the last charge was used. The item never really 
disappeared, and would reappear after re-logging. It no longer appears 
to disappear.

*Updated EQCLIENT.INI Documentation*

If the file does not exist it will be generated by eqgame.exe with 
default values. If an entry in the file is missing it will be added by 
eqgame.exe with default values.

*Today's Patch*

Today we modified the EverQuest client to implement the following 
changes:

- Corrected a bug that would cause players to crash if they entered the 
game, exited to the server selection screen, and tried to reenter the 
game.
- Corrected a bug that caused delays when switching between UI modes 
due to the text wrapping change implemented last week.
- The /book command (/book #) now accepts pages 1 through 50, and will 
switch to the proper page.
- Opening your spellbook will automatically cause you to begin 
meditating providing that you have the skill.
- Removed the /meditate command since it is no longer necessary.
- You can now activate a hotkey while the spellbook is open by pressing 
the corresponding number-key.
- The "/target [name]" command can be used to target other players by 
name. Please note that this ability is subject to the range to the 
target.
- EverQuest will now write the original default colors when creating 
the EQCLIENT.INI file, rather than the new colors that were put in a 
few weeks ago.
- The @-character can be used in emotes to indicate a target. For 
instance, if you target "a gnoll" and type "/emote laughs cruelly at 
@", the output will be, "Playername laughs cruelly at a gnoll".
- People with the /LFG (Looking for Group) flag set will now have their 
over-head name prefixed with an asterisk. Remember that you can search 
for people looking for a group by using the "/who" and "/who all" 
commands. Typing "/who all ranger 40 50 lfg" will return a list of all 
rangers between 40 and 50 that are looking for a group.
- The "Sense" series (Undead, Animal, and Summoned) will no longer 
point you towards people's pets.

*Note on Voice Recognition*

Last week we implemented voice recognition technology in EverQuest. To 
use this new feature, please refer to the EQROKManualSupplement.doc 
file in your EverQuest directory. Please note that you must already 
have a voice recognition engine that is compliant with the Microsoft 
Speech API (SAPI), version 4.0. The voice recognition technology was 
tested with Dragon NaturallySpeaking(r) v4.0. Check with the developer 
of your software to find out if it is SAPI 4.0 compliant.

*Guild Maintenance*

We are in the process of preparing to do maintenance on the guild 
database. To that end, guild creation and activation will be on hold 
for the next three weeks. After that time, we may be running a process 
to remove inactive or under-subscribed guilds from the system. We would 
ask and recommend that those in guilds with under 10 separate members 
(on separate accounts) consider merging and deleting the under-
subscribed guild. 

In addition, it's apparently become common practice for people wishing 
to register a guild to enter the chat server and advertise there for 
help creating the guild. This will no longer be permitted. People 
wishing to submit a guild must organize prior to entering the chat 
server. Advertising for assistance within the chat server could result 
in a short-term (24 hour) suspension for the account.

*Level 1 Character Purge*

The Level 1 character purge announced several weeks ago will take place 
on Wednesday, September 27, 2000, at 7:00am PST (GMT-7). Any level 1 
characters that haven't been played within the previous 30 days will be 
deleted. If you wish to keep any level 1 characters that you may have, 
please log in and play them between now and 9/27. 

***Patch Day***

As a testament to our on-going goal to constantly provide more content 
for EverQuest players, today's patch primarily consists of *many* 
content-additions to the game. 

*New Epic Quests*

We are pleased to announce that we have implemented new "Fiery Avenger" 
style quests for every class in the game (including paladins). The 
ultimate reward for each quest boasts a custom model with unique 
particle effects. We think that you will be pleased.

Good luck to everyone on your quest.

*Class Issues*

Rangers:

Last week we completed in-depth testing of melee and defensive skills 
for all melee-centric classes. In the course of these tests we 
determined that the ranger class was not performing to its intended 
level, and have made the following changes:

- The "Jolt" spell has had its casting time reduced.
- The Skillcap on Dodge and Parry has been increased.

Monks:

High-level monks can now carry increased weight without penalty. The 
additional allowance is granted at levels 55 and 60.

Cleric:

Celestial Elixir was failing due to multi-tick cure components that are 
incompatible with that configuration. We have therefore removed the 
cure components and increased the healing provided by this spell.

After a great deal of consideration, we have concluded that the Mark of 
Karn spell is imbalanced and requires correction. This spell's current 
function makes melee classes without dual-wield far less desirable 
members of the group. As such, the spell has had its duration 
decreased, its recast-time increased, and its "heal per hit" value 
decreased. 


*Fungal Regrowth*

"Fungal Regrowth" is now a self-only spell. It was being used as an 
offensive spell by virtue of its "snare" effect upon the target. 
Furthermore, we ruled out making it "group only" as with other spells 
that have this issue, due to a class-balance concern. The spell was 
reducing the group's desire for classes capable of casting regenerative 
magic.

*Attack Speed Buffs*

In this patch we corrected a bug that would cause any "Haste" item 
combined with any "Haste" spell to automatically yield maximum haste, 
regardless of the level of "Haste" granted by each individual 
component. This fix increases the usefulness of better "Haste" 
equipment and spells. The downside to this is that those who usually 
have both items and spells active will see a reduced attack-speed 
unless outfitted with the best equipment and spells.

*High-Level Dungeon Balancing*

Veehshan's Peak and Sebilis have received loot adjustments in order to 
address disparities in risk and reward. For the most part, the quality 
of the "common" loot in Veeshan's Peak is at least as good as the 
"rares" from Sebilis.

*Low-Delay Weapons and Damage Bonus Changes*

In accordance with our announcement several weeks ago, two low-delay 
weapons can now only be equipped in the off-hand. Included in this 
change are the Mosscovered Twig and the Barbed Scale Whip. The delay on 
these weapons and the associated damage bonus to weapons in the primary 
hand made these weapons much too powerful for their availability and 
the risk associated with their acquisition.

In addition, two-handed weapons have had their damage-bonus modified. 
The damage-bonus for low-delay two-handed weapons (27 or below) created 
a problem similar to the weapons above and has been reduced. The 
damage-bonus has not changed for normal-delay (28-39) two-handed 
weapons. The damage bonus for high-delay two-handed weapons (40+) has 
been increased.


*Server Selection Screen*

It has come to our attention that new players often think that the 
high-population servers are better, based upon the logic that if 
everyone else is there, it must be a good server. However, in 
Massively-Multiplayer games, less populated servers are often 
considered superior for gameplay. Therefore we have marked servers that 
would benefit from new characters as preferred servers, listing them in 
"green" in the server selection window. The preferred servers have 
populations such that an influx of new people would benefit the server 
rather than cause overpopulation.


*Custom Emotes and AFK*

Animations with custom emotes have been implemented. Current canned 
emotes such as /point allow a target other than the current target to 
be specified. That will continue to work. So if you type "/point 
Baobob", the usual text will come up. However, you can add custom text 
to the emote, but you must specify the target as "say" as the target. 
For instance: 

/point say points at a gnoll, indicating that he is ready to kill it. 

...your character will execute the /point animation, and the text 
output will be: "CharacterName points at a gnoll, indicating that he is 
ready to kill it." 

Finally, you can now set a custom message for when you are /AFK. Type 
"/AFK " (without the brackets) to set your custom AFK message. For 
instance, if you type "/afk Grabbing a snack", you will reply with 
"Grabbing a snack" when someone sends you a /tell.

*Skill Gain*

The skill-gain rate of many skills is now further modified by character 
stats. This will allow those with natural affinities towards certain 
skills to improve at a greater rate.

*Trade Skills Enhanced*

Many of the trade skills in game have received massive enhancements, 
including dozens of new craftable items, new fishing and foraging 
items, and other things to be discovered once in game. 

In addition, trade-skill specialization has been implemented. Players 
will be able to exceed 200 points of skill in ONE of the generally 
available tradeskills. This includes: 

- Baking
- Blacksmithing
- Brewing
- Jewelcraft
- Tailoring
- Fletching
- Pottery 

Once above 200 points in one of these skills, no other skill will be 
able to exceed 200. Specialization restrictions do not include class or 
race-specific trade skills such as Alchemy, Make Poison, and Tinkering. 
Players with race or class-specific trade skills will be able to exceed 
200 points of skill in that skill, PLUS any generally available trade 
skill. 

The enhancement of trade skills is an on-going project. Further 
enhancements will be made in the coming weeks.

***Patch Day*** 

The following changes have been implemented on the production servers 
as part of today's patch: 

*General Changes* 

- NPC corpses level 55 or over will now last 30 minutes before 
decaying. This should help those on large multi-group encounters who 
need some prep-time before looting items.
- The item "Woe" has been repaired. If you receive the "Item out of 
charges" message when your "Woe" attempts to fire its spell, please 
contact a GM to trade out the item.
- The spell "Mark of Karn" has been changed. The recast-time has been 
reduced significantly and the Hitpoint-return is now scaled inversely 
based upon the delay of the weapon. In addition, a hitpoint return will 
only take place when the target is hit with a primary melee weapon, or 
the primary hand if you are unarmed.
- Some more tradeskill component vendors have been placed within the 
world to make certain tradeskills easier to use in your home town.
- "AFK" and "LD" status will now be reported above player's heads. 

*Fleeing NPCs* 

Last week's patch caused NPCs to flee more than before due to a bug 
that was fixed. After evaluating the situation, we decided to reduce 
the chance to flee, but not to the extent that it was reduced before. 
NPCs were previously much more "brave" than they should have been. 

As part of the same change, charmed NPCs also began fleeing when low on 
health. We've determined that this is not a good situation for the 
players. As such, we have stopped charmed creatures from fleeing per 
player request. 

*Level 1 Character Purge* 

The Level 1 character purge has been completed. All level 1 characters 
that have not been played within the past 30 days have been deleted. 

*New Server Active* 

Tholuxe Paells, a new server open to new characters only, is now active 
and ready for play. Enjoy! As a reminder, /movelog registration will 
take place on Mithaniel Marr and Tunare Friday evening from 6PM to 
Midnight (PDT: GMT-7). 
Registered characters will be moved to a second new server, Drinal, 
early next week. 

***User Interface Changes*** 

Many UI enhancements were made in today's patch: 

*Moving and Resizing Windows* 

The data windows in the full screen "HUD" mode may now be moved by 
clicking in the upper left-hand corner, moving them to where you want, 
then clicking again. The "spell effect" and "chat" windows can be 
resized by clicking on the lower right-hand corner, dragging to the 
appropriate size, and then clicking again. Coordinates for window 
locations in each resolution are stored in the EQCLIENT.INI file. 

*Bugs with Several Commands Fixed* 

We fixed a problem with /book, /sit, and /doability that allowed them 
to be executed at inappropriate times, such as while charmed or feared. 
They should now only function when the native button would have 
functioned if pressed. 

*Miscellaneous Additions* 

Added the following /-commands: 

- /camp: Causes your character to camp out. You must be sitting to use 
/camp.
- /disband: Will disband you from your current group, or turn down an 
invitation to join another group.
- /invite: Will invite the target into a group, or accept an invitation 
if one is pending.
- /attack: Will toggle the state of "Auto-attack". You may also add a 
parameter of "on" or "off" to explicitly set the state. 

In addition: 

- CTRL-1 through CTRL-8 will cast the spell in the specified spell-
slot.
- ":" (colon: Short for /emote) and "'" (apostrophe: Short for /say) 
will now bring up the chat line in the same fashion as the /-key and 
ENTER.
- The "R" key (by default) takes you into reply-mode as always, 
bringing up a reply to the last person sending you a /tell. However, 
you can now TAB and SHIFT-TAB to cycle through the last 10 people that 
have sent you /tells. 

*Pauses in Socials* 

You may now enter pauses in social batches with the /pause command. 
/pause takes an argument from 1 to 600, with the value being equal to 
the number of tenths of seconds (i.e. /pause 100 will yield a 10 second 
pause). 

For example, a social consisting of: 
/sit off /cast 1 /pause 100 /sit on 

...would cause you to stand up, cast the spell in slot 1, wait 10 
seconds after you've STARTED casting the spell, and sit down. 

Furthermore, you can also use the /pause command on the same line as 
another social by separating the commands with a comma. Even though the 
pause command is specified first, it is executed AFTER the command on 
the same line. 

For example: 
/sit off /pause 100,/cast 1 /sit on 

...would have the same effect as the example above. It is important to 
note that the comma can only be used to separate a /pause command from 
another, and MUST be specified first on the line. 

*Emote Codes* 

The @ symbol has been replaced with a series of %-codes that expand 
into various pieces of information, and now works in ALL chat channels 
(emote, say, shout, ooc, auction, group, guild). 

The new %-codes are: 
%T - Returns the current target.
%S - Returns the subjective gender-specific pronoun for the target (He, She, It).
%O - Returns the objective gender-specific pronoun for the target (Him, Her, It).
%P - Returns the posessive gender-specific pronoun for the target (His, Her, Its).
%R - Returns the race of the target (only works on Player characters).

For example, if you have a target of "a gnoll", the following emote: 
/point say points at %T indicating that he is ready to kill %O. 

...Your character will execute the "point" animation with a text output 
of "CharacterName points at a gnoll indicating that he is ready to kill 
it."

*Today's Patch*

Today's patch consisted mostly of server-side changes, additions, and 
fixes regarding NPCs and quests. The only item of public note is that 
the Ragebringer can no longer be equipped in the ranged slot. A data 
entry error caused it to be initially allowed it to be equipped in that 
slot.

*Important System Configuration Announcement*. As many of you know, 
over the past couple of months we've made numerous enhancements to the 
EverQuest client. In addition to things such as new /-commands and 
other changes of that nature, we've enhanced the UI itself to allow 
moveable and resizable windows, among other things. At the same time 
we've been working on a brand new sound engine, and have been further 
concentrating on optimizing and expanding the capabilities of the 
EverQuest client.

For most applications, the feature set of a version of DirectX is 
limited to the lowest common denominator between the version that the 
software is compiled under, and the version running on the client. This 
means that though you may be running DirectX 7.0a already, and are 
receiving advantages associated with the more advanced code, the 
feature-set of DirectX used when in EverQuest is limited to version 
5.2.

This limits the type and breadth of enhancements that can be made to 
the client. Given that we feel that EverQuest players would enjoy 
continuing to see new enhancements for the client, we will soon begin 
compiling the client under DirectX 7.0a, and implementing the feature-
set available within that version. When we do this, everyone will need 
DirectX 7.0a (or higher) to play EverQuest. 

Here are some of the possible benefits from DirectX 7.0a:

- Better performance (Graphics and Sound)

- Gamma Correction working in D3D 
- Proper Mip-Mapping in D3D 
- Fixes fogging on some cards. (Some cards have no fogging at all and 
look pretty bad) 
- Allows us to use newer interfaces to support such features as full-
screen anti-aliasing, and alternate Z-buffering methods, which tend to 
look better.

Changing to DX7 does have a potential downside. Those using older or 
discontinued video or sound cards that do not have DX7 compatible 
drivers may need to upgrade to continue playing. However, we feel that 
the benefits that will come from upgrading to this newer version of 
DirectX outweigh the potential problems.

We plan to begin requiring DirectX7.0a when the EverQuest client is 
next patched, in two or three weeks. We wanted to be sure to give 
everyone enough time to check their version of DirectX and install the 
newest version. You can run DXDIAG.EXE in your Windows\System directory 
to check your DirectX version and get the newest version of DirectX 
from here if it is needed.

Please keep an eye on the patch message for further information 
regarding the planned implementation of DX7.

*Epic Quests*

Due to some difficulties regarding the Epic Quests implemented two 
patches ago, the epic quests for the Monk, Wizard, and Druid will not 
be completable until the next patch. While we would like to have 
implemented updates right away for these issues, we are mid-way in our 
conversion to support the DirectX changes that have been announced. 

We appreciate your patience.

***Patch Day***

Today's patch includes the announced code-updates to use technology 
included with DirectX 7. You MUST have DirectX 7 or higher installed in 
order to play EverQuest. Please refer to 
http://everquest.station.sony.com/f_requirements.shtml prior to 
contacting technical support for procedures prior to contacting 
technical support.

Today's patch also includes the new "Sound Engine" that we've been 
speaking about for some time. The new sound engine supports additional 
EAX features and should address the concerns of SBLive users that have 
been posted in the past.

*Movelog for Povar and Tarew Marr*

The /movelog window will be opened for Povar and Tarew Marr on Saturday 
11/18 and Sunday 11/19 from 6PM PST (GMT-8) to Midnight. All players 
wishing to have all of their characters moved (on a per-account basis) 
from those servers to the new split-server should execute "/movelog 
yes" during the windows.

The physical character move will take place next week on Tuesday or 
Wednesday. Please check the scheduled downtime page of 
www.everquest.com for a firm time when it is decided. Remember that 
corpses will not follow you to the new server, so anyone deciding to 
move will want to be sure that all corpses are looted prior to the time 
of the actual move. 

As this patch features new /movelog logic to eliminate problems with 
people being left behind, players should not count on customer-service 
intervention after the physical move if they were unable to execute the 
command during the window. You will need to be present and execute the 
command in order to move.

*Spell Changes*

-- Pixie Strike: Made it less resistible by reducing the secondary 
resist.
-- Song of Twilight: Increased duration. Made less resistible by 
removing the secondary resist. Allowed it to be cast at any time of 
day.
-- Fixed the effect on the Necromancer Epic Quest Item. The effect was 
checking resist on each tick instead of running full course.
-- Increased the duration of the effect on the Enchanter Epic Quest 
Item.
-- Fixed the "Modulating Rod" so that it can be used by the appropriate 
races.
-- Fixed the Lost Staff of the Scorned
-- Maniacal Strength will now correctly overwrite the level 49 strength 
spell.
-- The Death Pact and Divine Intervention spells will now stack 
appropriately with other spells that have similar effects.

-- Modified the "Jonathan's" line of songs to remove the "skin" effect 
in order to allow bards to use them more effectively in combat. In 
addition, we made them "Self Only" spells rather than "Single Target" 
spells in order to allow bards to remain in combat while singing them.

*General Fixes/Changes*

-- Fixed a bug that caused an NPC on "Sister's Isle" to attack people 
who were fighting pirates.
-- Removed Paladins as an authorized class for piercing weapons in game 
since they do not have the piercing skill.
-- The "Belt of the River" quest should now work correctly.
-- Fixed all known problems with the class-specific epic quests.
-- Implemented some new race-specific quests for Iksar.
-- Positively modified most Epic Quest Items. Please check your items 
to see your changes. Note: Not all changes will be evident by looking 
at the item.
-- Fixed the NPC bosses in the Plane of Sky that were not dropping the 
correct loot.
-- Your bread tin will now be returned when baking bread.
-- Fixed the Wellford Fargin keyword problem in Firiona Vie.
-- Made the "Gravebinder" a magic weapon.

-- Repaired the Forager Bag. It was causing people to lose weight when 
placing items in the bag. It is supposed to have a weight reduction 
component, but was not supposed to cause weight loss.

-- Taunt: Increased effectiveness above level 50. Previously, creatures 
above level 50 could not be taunted by means of the taunt skill. Now, 
most creatures below the character's level can now be successfully 
taunted. As a note, the chance to taunt a creature above 50th level is 
smaller than that of a creature below 50th.


*Client Enhancements*

-- You now have 10 pages of 10 hotboxes each when in full screen mode.
-- You can now customize 10 pages of 12 socials each, increasing the 
total number of available socials by 108.
-- Fixed a bug with the keyboard.txt file causing some keys to 
translate incorrectly.
-- Fixed a bug that caused some window positions to save improperly at 
higher resolutions.
-- All key mappings are now stored in the EQCLIENT.INI file.

-- Fixed all known problems with the clipping plane slider. Users 
should now see differences for the entire range of adjustment in zones 
that support an adjustable clipping plane.

-- Players on PvP servers will no longer show "[LD]" over their heads 
when linkdead. In addition, these same players will no longer show as 
"LinkDead" in the /who list.

-- Players can now set custom text colors while in game. /usercolor: 
Usage "/usercolor UserColorNumber R G B" where "UserColorNumber is the 
number of the color as indicated in the EQCLIENT.INI file, and R, G, 
and B are red, green and blue respectively. All changes will be 
automatically saved to your EQCLIENT.INI file.

-- OPT files in your EverQuest directory now have a number after the 
character name indicating the server number. As such, you will now be 
able to have characters of the same name on two separate servers with 
different custom options.

-- The eqlog.txt file now has a name that includes the server number 
and character name. For instance, if your character is named "Bobb", 
and you are on Server 1, your log text file name would be 
eqlog_01_Bobb.txt.

-- Added two new entries to the "Defaults" section of the EQCLIENT.INI 
file: AttackOnAssist=TRUE|FALSE - Sets whether or not your autoattack 
turns on automatically when assisting. Defaults to "TRUE". 
ShowInspectMessage=TRUE|FALSE - Sets whether or not you see the 
"Soandso is inspecting you" message. Defaults to "TRUE".

-- Custom key mappings have been greatly enhanced. You can now set two 
keys, a primary and an alternate, for each function in game. In 
addition, things that were previously not customizable can now be set 
to a key of your preference. Left-click on the key identifier to set 
the primary key, right-click to set the secondary.

-- Added the /note command. /note will append the following text to a 
file called "notes.txt" in your EverQuest directory. For instance, 
typing "/note This is a note" will put "This is a note" on the next 
line in the notes.txt file.

*Follow-up Patch*

Today's follow-up patch addresses the following issues from yesterday's 
patch:

- The spell Torpor received an unintentional reduction in effectiveness
- Illumination in game was not as bright as it should have been.
- Pet using classes unintentionally gained the ability to summon 
multiple pets.
- Bard songs were reacting poorly with invisibility/hide/sneak.
- Hitpoints were being reported incorrectly to clients.
- Changing resolutions would cause some to crash.

In addition, the following changes were left out of yesterday's patch 
message:

- Fixed a bug that would cause some to not be able to cast after being 
feared.
- Data for group members and targets will be updated more frequently. 
This change should reduce complaints of warping and slow hitpoint and 
other updates.
- Bards received increases in the skill cap for their instrument 
skills.
- Changed the default combo for casting spells from CTRL-1:8 to ALT-
1:8, as CTRL was interfering with players ability to strafe.

Thank you for your continued patience.

*Patch Day*

Today's patch addresses a few problems noted by customers since last 
week's big patch. The following changes were made:

- Fixed some problems with sound volume being set above the maximum or 
below the minimum.
- Fixed a problem that caused sound volume to be reset regardless of 
the slider setting upon zoning or entering game.
- Fixed a bug that would cause some sounds to be unduly amplified 
whenever the volume slider was moved.
- Fixed a bug causing pink fringes to show on whiskers in association 
with mipmapping.
- Fixed a bug with /usercolor causing settings to be saved in the wrong 
slot.
- Fixed weapon scaling problems with off-hand weapons and those carried 
by dwarves. 
- Fixed a bug that caused the client to display an amount of experience 
in slight disagreement with the server.
- Fixed the Paladin Epic Quest reward, which was procing a spell that 
would do around one million points of damage if left to its own 
devices.
- Fixed a faction problem that made some quests designed to be doable 
by anyone, regardless of race or class, undoable. 

In other news, the Tarew/Povar split server, Xev, will be up following 
the patch today. Xev is named for Xev Bristlebane, the god of fortune. 
We would have named the new server under its full name if not for an 
attempt to avoid confusion between the existing "Bristlebane" server 
(named for Fizzlethorpe Bristlebane) and Xev.

- The EverQuest Team

November 29, 2000  3:00 am
------------------------------

*Patch Day*

Today's patch includes updates to the client to address some problems 
reported by people in regards to the DX7 update, as well as other 
gameplay issues:

- Corrected an older bug that would cause people to stop gaining or 
losing faction with associates when the primary faction was at its 
maximum or minimum. Players will now be able to further modify 
associate factions in the appropriate direction.

- Random-effects on weapons carried by pets will now behave as if the 
pet is a player character rather than an NPC. The change last patch 
reduced them to a rate below player characters. As part of this patch, 
target-specific random effects will only work if the target is the 
intended type. For instance, a weapon that processes "Dismiss Summoned" 
will only "go off" on a summoned NPC instead of everything. 

- Added some code that should address if not eliminate a problem 
reported by people whereas the client would "freeze" for a second or 
two every few minutes. For those who do not have IRQ sharing and/or 
driver problems, this should address the issue.

- Made final positive modifications to several Epic Quest rewards. 
Included in these changes: the SK weapon will now allow you to bash 
while carrying it. 

- Fixed a problem that gave people problems when exiting the game and 
attempting to get back in.

- Added some code to address reports from people who find exiting from 
the character-select screen back to the server-select screen rather 
slow when mip-mapping is enabled. Most of this problem is due to 
routines in DX required to release resources consumed by mip-mapping 
and may not be addressable until the next version of DirectX is 
adopted.

- Changed customizable key mappings so that the ESC key will clear the 
"NOKEY" setting instead of the "Backspace". This means that you can now 
assign "Backspace" to a function in game.

- Corrected a sound problem that would cause certain sounds to be 
played "rapid-fire" under some circumstances. There is still a 
potential for this to happen with some other sounds that will be 
addressed in a patch in the near future.

- Corrected a problem in Kedge Keep that made the top encounter more 
difficult than intended after the server had been up for a while.

- Higher level Magician, Necromancer, and Shadowknight pets now have 
the ability to dual-wield without being handed weapons. The calculation 
used to determine whether or not this ability exists takes several 
things into account, but for the most part 39th level and above summons 
(higher for the Shadowknight) will have this ability. It is possible 
that you could get a "good" 34th level pet that will, or a "bad" 39th 
level pet that will not have this ability. 

- Bards of the land, hark unto me: The notes have been scribed on 
tattered parchment, two score and nine, for you they are meant. Abandon 
your mates, though they may fume, and follow the call of the seafarer's 
tune.

- The Monk's hand-to-hand skill cap has been raised to a level equal to 
their one-handed blunt skill.

Remember! Only a few days left until the launch of EverQuest: The Scars 
of Velious. Reserve your copy at your local retailer today!

*SBLive Soundcards and Hardware Acceleration*

Due to some past problems with SBLive cards, users of those cards who 
called into tech support were asked to turn "Hardware Acceleration" 
down one notch in DXDIAG. The last patch corrected those problems and 
most users should again increase hardware acceleration to maximum. 

To do this:

1. Click "Start"
2. Click "Run"
3. Type "DXDIAG.EXE" and press enter.
4. Click on the "Sound" tab.
5. Increase the "Hardware Acceleration" slider to maximum.

Doing this should correct issues such as not hearing certain sounds or 
sound volume disparities. 

The only users who may not want to do this are Windows 2000 users. 
Creative Labs is currently working on new drivers for Win2K, so you may 
wish to wait until these drivers are completed prior to increasing 
hardware acceleration.

Finally, all SBLive users should get LiveWare 3.0 from 
http://www.soundblaster.com/liveware/ After installing LiveWare, you 
will then want to REINSTALL the latest drivers for your sound card. The 
order of installation is important.

*Velious Patch*

Today's patch requires that Velious subscribers press the "Velious 
Patch" button on the patch program UI.

*Emergency Patch* 

We appreciate everyone's patience while we address a few issues as tens 
of thousands of new players check out Velious. This emergency patch 
addresses several issues:

- The transparent inventory screen will no longer come up in 640x480 
resolution. It was not supposed to come up as the available screen 
space is not large enough to house the new screen. 

- "Disabled" windows in full screen mode will no longer interfere with 
mouse clicks.

- Addressed some item drop bugs in Skyshrine that had the highest-level 
loot dropping off of yard fodder. This has been addressed with a 
retroactive item change. We apologize for the inconvenience.

- Several disciplines (Resistant, Trueshot, Unholyaura, and Holyforge) 
have been upgraded. Please read the updated EQManual_Supplement.doc (or 
.txt) in your EverQuest Directory.

- "Dragon Circles" have been fully implemented. In short, you will not 
be able to receive a teleport to a dragon circle unless you've been to 
the circle before and carry a soulbound souvenir that spawns at the 
circle. Please read the updated EQManual_Supplement. 

- Innate class-based resistances implemented a year or so ago did not 
take into account levels 50 through 60 with exception to those provided 
to the warrior. As such, each class that has class-based resistance 
bonuses (with exception to the warrior) will get an additional bonus as 
they level from 50 to 60.

- The problem of blank faction messages being reported to the players 
has been corrected. 

- Screenshots are again enabled.

Overall the Velious launch is going very well. We are happy to see that 
the problems found so far are minor and that we can address them 
quickly.

December 7, 2000  4:00 am
------------------------------

*Patch Day*

Today's patch addresses a few issues brought up by players over the 
last several days:

- Fixed an issue with /split that would cause people to go linkdead in 
the event that they used the command in quick succession.
- Fixed a bug where you could not edit socials or skills (via the 
hotbutton window right click) in fullview mode if you had hidden your 
"MainMenu" window.
- Fixed a bug where you would not see hotbuttons in "normal" mode if 
you had hidden that window in fullview mode.
- Fixed it so you can't use hotbuttons when looting, trading, banking, 
or using a merchant in fullview mode (which is how it is in normal 
mode, but with the inventory working in fullview mode now it wasn't 
blocked properly for that).
- Fixed the message for the /dynamiclights command to report properly.
- Fixed a problem where INI setting were not being read properly if you 
had camped or went LD to server select then reentered the game. This 
was causing various UI problems with window positions and colors being 
wrong.
- Fixed a problem with Sirens Grotto - Some people entering the zone 
were getting stuck.
- Fixed a problem with passage from Skyshrine to Cobalt Scar. Travel in 
that direction was supposed to require a key.
- We believe we fixed a problem where NPCs sometimes would hit a pet-
owner no matter how far away the owner was from the pet and the NPC. 
- Corrected loot drops in Thurgadin.

We again appreciate patience while we stabilize following Velious 
launch.

Please run the "Velious Patch" off of the patch program.

*New Patch*

We appreciate everyone's continued patience over the past couple of 
days, and are happy to see that the problems that have been experienced 
are relatively minor compared to those of the past. Tonight's patch is 
expected to be the last one we'll have to do for a while, so we hope to 
have you enjoying Velious over the weekend non-stop.

Today's patch corrects the following issues:

- The user interface problems that occurred as of last night have been 
addressed, such as window positioning and transparency. Also addressed 
were problems with targeting, enabling and disabling windows, and 
switching to and from resolutions above 1280x1024.
- Corrected a problem that would cause some Voodoo card users to lock 
up when killing giants.
- Added messages for some new skills that some NPCs have (e.g. Rampage, 
and Flurry). 
- Fixed items and item drops in a number of zones.

Enjoy your weekend!

*New Velious Subscribers*

Please don't forget to run the "Velious Patch" off of the patch 
program.

*New Server*

We have a new server that will be coming up next week before the 
holidays. It will be a split server for Solusek Ro, Karana, and Cazic-
Thule. Solusek Ro (which had about 200 people moved off about 9 months 
ago) and Karana (whose last split about 6 months ago did not go very 
well) will be split again with Cazic-Thule. 

Though the population of Solusek Ro and Karana at peak usage times is 
not excessive, those two servers actually peak about 6 hours before the 
other servers due to a large overseas population. This is why they are 
being split as opposed to other servers.

/movelog registration for the three servers being moved will open this 
Saturday at 10am (GMT-8). It will remain open through 12 AM Monday, a 
total of 38 hours. We apologize for the short notice but to delay the 
move any longer would mean putting it off until well after the 
Holidays. 

By typing "/movelog yes" within the registration window, you indicate 
that you would like all characters on the existing account moved to the 
new server. The moves themselves will take place on Tuesday of next 
week.

We also have a new non-split server planned for the very near future as 
well. It will most likely not go up until after the Holidays. If that 
changes, we'll be sure to let everyone know.

*Movelog Reminder*

We want to remind players on Solusek Ro, Karana, and Cazic-Thule that 
registration for move to the new split-server will open 10am PST (GMT-
8) today and will remain open until 12:00am Monday. 

To register all of your characters on those servers for the move, you 
must type "/movelog yes" while in-game. Again, you only have to type 
the command while logged in to *one* character. It counts for all 
characters on that account and server.

December 19, 2000  3:00 am
------------------------------

*Patch Day*

Today's patch primarily consists of tuning of Velious zones as well as 
content and other additions. In addition, the following changes have 
been implemented on the Live servers:

- High-end items that have a activatable (right-click) healing effect 
have in several cases had their casting times increased. 
- Factions for some of the higher end encounters in Velious have 
received some adjustments. Basically, "bad acts" receive more weight 
than "good acts". For instance, if "A" hates "B" and "B" hates "A", 
killing "A" will hurt your faction with "A" more than it will help your 
faction with "B".
- The stamina reduction with "Resurrection Effects" has been replaced 
by a slight attack-speed debuff.
- The Ranger's Trueshot discipline now works correctly. It was 
previously only working versus other player characters.
- The Shadow Knight's "Unholy Aura" discipline has received an 
enhancement. When in use, harmtouch resistances will be checked versus 
disease instead of magic. In addition, harmtouch will resist in the 
same fashion as lifetap spells, meaning that unless the creature is 
immune to disease, you should get full damage most of the time.
- The spell attached to the "Fiery Defender" can now be partially 
resisted instead of being "all or nothing". The net result is that the 
average damage will be higher.
- The Paladin "Holy Forge" discipline will now give paladins triple the 
normal chance of scoring a critical hit. Each critical hit has a 
percent chance to be scored as a critical blow.
- Added parameters to the /camp command (the command that will cause 
you to camp out if you are already sitting). "/camp server" will take 
you back to the server selection screen. "/camp desktop" will take you 
out to the desktop following a successful camp. Despite popular 
request, "/camp spawn" will not be implemented.
- Walruses now indeed sound like they should.
- Added the /chatfontsize [0 to 5] (default is 1) command. This command 
will allow players to adjust the size of the font in the chat window.

***Patch Day***

We're happy to present today's patch, which focuses primarily on 
addressing issues that have been brought forth by EverQuest players. We 
appreciate the opportunity to spend some time focusing on specific 
issues important to you. Today's patch includes the following:

*Disciplines*

- The "Resistant" Discipline now lasts 5 minutes instead of the 
previous 1.
- The "Holy Forge" Discipline now lasts 5 minutes instead of the 
previous 2.
- The "Weaponshield" Discipline now lasts 20 seconds instead of the 
previous 15.
- The "Leechcurse" Discipline now lasts 20 seconds instead of the 
previous 15.
- The "Deftdance" Discipline now lasts 15 seconds instead of the 
previous 10.
- The "Puretone" Discipline now lasts 4 minutes instead of the previous 
2.
- The "Sanctification" discipline now lasts 15 seconds instead of the 
previous 10.
- The "Unholy Aura" Discipline now gives a 50% bonus to Harmtouch 
(compared with the previous 25%) and causes it to save versus disease, 
which should result in even fewer resists in most high-level 
encounters.

*Spells*

- "Lay on Hands" has been improved starting at 40th level.
- The "Summon Corpse" spell is now available to Shadowknights.
- Corrected a bug that was causing damage while using the "Trueshot" 
Discipline to be the same regardless of the quality of your bow.
- The spells "Focus of Spirit" and "Visions of Grandeur" now stack.
- "Harmtouch" is now resisted as if it were a "Lifetap" spell, meaning 
that it is all-or-nothing, and nearly unresistable with exception to 
encounters that are immune to magic or out of the acceptable level 
range. In addition, maximum damage for Harmtouch has been increased 
starting at 40th level.
- We fixed a bug that caused "Lure" type spells (Wizards) to be 
resisted more than they should have been in certain types of 
encounters.
- Melee attack timers will no longer be reset when a SK, Paladin, or 
Ranger cast a spell. Previously these classes had to wait a full attack 
delay after casting before they would attack via melee again. 

*Miscellaneous*

- You may now adjust the clipping plane in the Hole. Previously, the 
clipping plane was fixed. Many people requested the ability to bring 
the clipping plane closer to allow them to improve their client's 
performance.
- Fixed several problems with trade-skill components that were not 
dropping. Also added some new recipes.
- Fixed the Iksar "Shackle of Steel" quest. 
- The additional options for /camp (/camp server, /camp desktop) have 
been implemented. /camp server will take you to the server-selection 
screen. /camp desktop will cause EverQuest to terminate and take you to 
the desktop.

*Root and Snare*

Root-type spells and "snare" type spells now use a separate spell 
effect. 

Previously, "Root" spells would overwrite any snare effect upon the 
target. When the root would wear off, the target began moving at full 
speed. With this change, when root wears off, snare will still be in 
effect. This has a few added effects on the other end. 

For instance, root will no longer cancel SoW or Journeyman's Boots 
effects. It also allowed us to correct a long-standing bug that was 
allowing bards to cancel root on themselves by playing Selo's 
Accelerando if Selo's was in effect at the time that the bard was 
rooted. As mentioned in a previous patch where the first part of this 
bug was fixed, this was not the intended effect.

*Looting NODROP Items*

A new command is now available to EverQuest players. 

In order to prevent the accidental looting of NODROP items, the 
/lootnodrop command has been added to the client. The command supports 
three options: ALWAYS (Default) - You will be presented with a yes/no 
confirmation box when attempting to loot any NODROP item. SOMETIMES - 
You will be presented with a yes/no confirmation box when attempting to 
loot any NODROP items that your race and/or class cannot use. NEVER - 
NODROP items will be looted without confirmation. 

It is highly recommended that you DO NOT CHANGE this from the default 
option, as the GM staff cannot assist in cases of accidental looting.

*Baltimore Fan Faire - Last Chance*

Monday is the registration deadline for the Baltimore Fan Faire! We are 
almost sold out so hurry and visit 
http://everquest.station.sony.com/fanfaire/fanfaire.html before you 
miss your chance to attend this event!

*Patch Day*

The primary focus of today's patch is to implement changes noted in the 
new Producer's Letter which can be found at 
http://everquest.station.sony.com/news/letter.shtml

It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you read the Producer's Letter before 
playing EverQuest. It contains some unprecedented and exciting 
enhancements to gameplay.

In addition to these changes, the following changes have been 
implemented:

*Bug Fixes*

- Fixed a bug that caused "root" and "snare" type spells to function 
incorrectly when stacked. They should now stack properly.
- Fixed a bug that negated the "instrument modifier" for bards using 
Selo's, causing them to run slower than they otherwise would. 
- Fixed a bug that allowed two or more spells that grant levitation to 
stack. Levitation spells should not stack.
- The "Track Corpse" spell now works.
- Tracked down and eliminated several bugs that were causing a very 
small percentage of people to crash when zoning or upon entering the 
game.
- Fixed a problem with some Ulthork armor that caused it to disappear 
on death if the wearer was of extremely low level.
- Tserrina's Whip has been fixed. If you received one prior to today's 
patch, you will need to trade out your whip with a GM in order to get 
one that works correctly.
- Last week's patch attempted to fix Celestial Elixir, Celestial 
Healing, and Torpor, so that they would stack another similar spell, 
unintentionally causing it to stop stacking with standard regeneration 
spells. This has been fixed. The downside to this fix is that these 
spells will now overwrite the "Call of Bones" series. As the three 
former spells are cast to save a character's life, this solution 
appears to be the most beneficial for all of those involved. 
- The stronger /lootnodrop options will no longer prompt you for 
confirmation when looting your own corpse. It is highly suggested that 
everyone reset their option to the strongest security available: 
/lootnodrop ALWAYS (always ask for confirmation).
- Added some code to address an issue reported by a few players, that 
being that an NPC named "Ragefire" would die and not leave a corpse. 
Though we were unable to reproduce this problem in testing, the code we 
added should function as a catch-all for this problem. Please be sure 
to let us know how this goes.


*Changes/Enhancements*

- While not mentioned in the Producer's Letter, the Zone Experience 
Modifier has also been increased in Guk (guktop), by roughly 12%.
- "Lay on Hands" has been enhanced again to heal more hitpoints.
- Overlooked in the last patch message, new spells were made available 
to Rangers and Paladins in the upper levels. 
- "Voice of the Berserker", a beneficial spell, no longer drains mana 
over the duration of the spell.
- The maximum duration of "Strength of Nature" has been increased.
- A new spell for magicians is now available in game.
- The "Shield of the Eighth" spell will now last a number of minutes 
equal to your level.
- You can now use the arrow and enter keys to select characters in the 
character select screen. In addition, the last character you chose will 
be automatically hilighted when entering that screen. This value is 
stored in the EQCLIENT.INI file as "LastCharSel=0-7"
- The ranger's "Trueshot" discipline has had its damage increased after 
analyzing data from its fix last week. Prior to the last patch, all 
bows, while under the discipline, were hitting as if they were 45dmg 
bows regardless of the delay. Last week's patch fixed it so that damage 
was based on the damage of the bow. This weeks patch increases damage 
bonuses in relation to delay (longer delays yield better damage 
bonuses). 
- You can now reverse the left and right channels on your speakers 
using the /reversesound command. This should be very useful for those 
who have had to place their speakers backwards due to cable lengths.
- Made some improvements to Paw, Mistmoore, and The Hole, to address 
some concerns brought forth by the players. Both zones had some 
problems that would cause them to be exceedingly difficult in some 
cases.

*QA Openings* 

Our Quality Assurance department is looking for some AVID EQ gamers to 
join us as testers at the San Diego branch. If you would like more 
information please visit www.verant.com or mail your resume to 
resume@station.sony.com with "QA Openings" as the Subject. 

Applicants should include their time playing EverQuest, and their 
number of characters and their respective classes and levels as part of 
their resume. 

*Small Patch* 

The EverQuest Team is currently hard at work evaluating, planning, and 
documenting our project plans for the current year. As such, we did not 
plan game updates during this period, forecasted to last a few weeks. 

However, given today's server maintenance being performed by our 
Operations Team, we were able to include a few small updates. These 
include some minor polishing on the Plane of Mischief, as well as the 
placement of the wizard's Velious teleport spells on merchants. 

Very soon, we'll be back to our continual plans to enhance the game 
world. We'll be sure to let you know what we have planned as we can.

*Patch Day*

Today's patch contains a wide variety of enhancements and changes. Due 
to the number of changes being made, this list is primarily a summary. 
Extended descriptions of the changes and the reasoning behind them can 
be solicited on the EverQuest Message Boards.

*Spell and Skill Changes*

Druids, Shaman, and Clerics:
--- Superior Healing moved to level 51 for shamans and druids. 
--- Casting difficulty of Superior Heal reduced (less fizzles)
--- New level 55 Druid and shaman spell, Chloroblast, similar to remedy 
for clerics.
--- New Druid spell at level 60, upgrade to superior healing, Natures 
Touch.
--- Created a new spell effect for Celestial Healing, Celestial Elixir, 
and Torpor. This will allow them to stack with all other spells, save 
spells of the same type (Heal over time). Prior to this, all heal-over-
time spells followed the same rules as regeneration spells.
--- Reduced the casting difficulty of Remedy.
--- Lowered recast time on Wake of Karana

Paladins:
--- Added Endure Magic spell at level 30
--- Added Resist Magic at 55
--- Moved Guard spell from 49 to 39
--- Moved Armor of Faith from 53 to 49
--- Added New level 53 paladin spell: Divine Glory
--- Added New level 59 spell: Celestial Cleansing 
--- Defense skill cap made exactly same as warriors
--- Added Yaulp 4 at 60 and enhanced.

Shadowknights:
--- Removed artificially inflated mana cost for pre level 50 lifetap 
spells. Please note that post-50 lifetap spells never had an inflated 
mana cost.
--- Moved Spirit Tap to level 55
--- Moved Drain Spirit to level 57
--- Added Drain Soul at level 60
--- Grim Aura added at level 22 and enhanced
--- Moved Shieldskin to level 34
--- Pet buff added at 29
--- Added Diamondskin spell at 59
--- Defense skill cap made exactly same as warriors
--- Due to the recent improvements to "Harmtouch", it is doing much 
more damage than it would before and unbalances PvP. As such it will 
now do less damage in PvP (68% of PvE, down from 80%). In addition, 
Shadowknights on the PvP servers were routinely killing themselves via 
non-XP losing means and attacking other players with Harmtouch 
immediately upon respawn. In order to address this situation, Harmtouch 
is no longer automatically "recharged" by death on the PvP Servers.
--- The "Lifeleech" discipline now increases hit probability in 
addition to its other effects.


Rangers:
--- Added Endure Cold at 22
--- Added Skin Like Nature at 59
--- Added FireFist at 22
--- Moved Bramblecoat from 49 to 39
--- Added Spikecoat at 49
--- Added resist cold at 55
--- Added Panic Animal at 22
--- Moved Jolt to 51
--- Moved Spirt of Wolf from 39 to 30
--- Added Cinder Jolt (fire-based Jolt spell) at 55.
--- Offense and weapons skill made identical to warriors
--- Added See Invisible at 39

Bards:
--- Added new level 20 Bard Song: Cassindra`s Chant of Clarity
--- Bards defensive skill made exactly the same as a warriors
--- Changed it so that the bard spell Denon's Desperate Dirge to 
increase damge by 10pts per level over 45. Also made it so the spell 
does 20% more damage using the Puretone discipline.

Magicians:
--- Added new level 59 spell: Valiant Companion
--- Added new level 39 spell: Summon Companion
--- Rain spells no longer count pets against total number of entities 
they can damage (all rain spells)
--- Added level 29 spell for Mages: Expedience

Enchanters: 
--- Lowered recast time on Visions of Grandeur

*Bug Fixes*

--- Aggressive and Defensive disciplines have been fixed. Before they 
would only affect damage taken and not affect damage dealt out. Now 
they affect both as designed.
--- Fixed the bug with going to the spellbook when the inventory window 
was up in fullview mode. It should work now. Also, fixed a minor bug 
where if you were in normal mode and tried to go to the spellbook from 
inventory via /book or the keymapped key it would not go, and it would 
make the done button not work properly for the inventory mode.
--- Fixed NPC melee ranges to be the same as for player characters. In 
other words, if you can hit the NPC, he can hit you. This bug was a 
problem with one dragon that could be hit, but could not hit back.
--- Fixed a bug that made it impossible to "Call of the Hero" someone 
out of water or lava.
--- Fixed the proc on the Chilled Scythe. Owners of this item will need 
to swap it out with a GM.
--- The Kromzek Surveyor Scope now fits in the "Ranged" slot rather 
than the "Ammo" slot as before.
--- Fixed a bug that caused the two single-target bard snare songs to 
break too soon in some cases.
--- Fixed a bug whereby NPCs would consider the race of a player prior 
to the loading of the faction table upon zoning or logging in. This 
would cause people to be attacked by things that normally like them. 
--- Players should now be properly removed from the group regardless of 
how they exit the game.

*Misc Changes*

--- Added text labels to the fullview inventory window "body" slots 
(Available only to Velious Subscribers)
--- Added the ability to toggle those labels on and off. Use 
/invwinlabels [on/off] (or no arguments to toggle). This is saved in 
the eqclient.ini file in the [Defaults] section with the key 
InvWinLabels=[TRUE/FALSE]
--- Increased the pre-50 bind-wounds cap for rogues and warriors.
--- Pickpocket now works to a max of 5 levels below you, or level 
45...whichever is greater... You can pickpocket NPC up to level 55 if 
you are level 60. 
--- The mouse pointer will now move at a multiple of its normal speed 
when you adjust the MousePointerSpeedMod setting in the eqclient.ini 
file. You can set that multiple on-the-fly with the /mousespeed 
command.
--- The "AutoHelp" feature that can be set under the options menu has 
been enhanced. Spell casters in particular might want to turn it on and 
try depressing the ALT key. It's perfect for refreshing your memory in 
regards to your spell lineup.
--- If you are interrupted while trying to cast a spell that uses a 
component, you will no longer use that component. Jewelers should be 
very pleased with this change.
--- Reduced the casting difficulty (fizzle rate) of all spells over 
level 56. Spells have always previously been set up so that it's 
usually more efficient to use a spell from a previous circle than the 
current one. The formula did not take into account the fact that 
everyone stops at 60.
--- Changed it so that players will now lose experience when they die 
in the Arena in Kael Drakkel. It seems that people were fighting giants 
in that arena in order to avoid the death penalty.
--- Naked PC corpses that have experience and are above level 30 will 
now last 3 hours instead of 3 minutes.
--- Avatar and Focus of Spirit should now stack
--- Raised the pre and post 50 bind wounds cap for paladins, clerics, 
druids, and shaman.

*Item Changes*

--- The effect on the "Frost Giant Beard" can now be used at 35th level 
rather than level 50.
--- The Wurmslayer will now fit in a bag. 
--- Iksar can now use the Ashenbone Shield
--- Chandged Crystallized Shadow leggings to rentable
--- Changed Gorilla Hide Leggings to show up as leather, was cloth 
before
--- Changed Envy from a piercing weapon to a shield so players could 
Bash with it. Envy is a parrying dagger.
--- The Shralok Pack is now LORE. It was set to pending-lore some time 
ago.
--- The Guardian and Sentry Armor bracers are no longer LORE.
--- Donal's Breastplate can now only be used on any individual target 
once every 7.5 minutes. This addresses some of the balance issues that 
became apparent given the existence of a mana-free complete heal.

*Trades and Crafts*

--- Fixed the Gator Roll baking recipe.
--- Repaired the notetext instructions for creating a Mixing Bowl with 
pottery. 
--- Repaired Holgresh Fur Cap and Holgresh Fur Moccasins tailoring 
recipes.
--- Made it so that the file is returned in addition to the hammer when 
a character fails to forge any of the various chain jointings.
--- Repaired Recipe for Enchanted Tier`Dal Adamantite Bracelet
--- Made it so that the Dwarven Smithy Hammer is returned on a failure 
to forge Brellium Chain Jointing.
--- Repaired Field Plate Boots smithing recipe
--- Changed the name of the smithed Enchanted Cabilis Scale armor to 
Imbued Cabilis Scale armor for naming convention reasons.
--- Repaired the recipe for converting 3 Enchanted Large Adamantite 
Bricks into 1 Enchanted Block of Adamantite in the Tier`Dal Forge, it 
was previously only possible in the Oggok Forge.
--- Made it so that the Bread Tin is returned upon a failure to bake 
bread.
--- Mithril and Velium Bonings will be stackable.
--- Mithril Studs will be stackable.

*NPC AI - Hate*

We've made a number of changes to NPC AI, specifically to the section 
dealing with target-selection, or what's commonly referred to as 
"Hate". It is not so much that NPCs react differently to hate now than 
before, but that we've changed the way that hate is awarded. 

--- We reduced the amount of hate that can be caused by a proc. Due to 
the high proc rates at upper levels, the amount of hate generated from 
procs, and the spells that were selected for those procs, made keeping 
the attention of the creature much too easy a task for the tank. 
Simply, it nearly eliminated the challenge of keeping a foes attention 
at levels above 50.

--- We've capped the amount of hate that can be awarded to most 
casters, specifically for debuff-type spells like the Malo and Tash 
series. The hate calculation for these spells takes into account the 
number of hitpoints of the NPC and did not "play nice" with the 
increased HP limit of Velious. It explains why Enchanters, for 
instance, would complain that casting a Tash spell would lead to near-
instant death.

--- We've redressed the amount of hate generated by heal spells. 
Previously, and *partly* due to a bug, the high level heal spells such 
as superior heal or complete heal would generate no more hate than 
greater heal. In fact, so little hate was generated by these spells 
that it made controlling NPC aggression trivial. Heal spells will now 
generate an amount of hate more in line with the number of hitpoints 
actually healed. Due to our desire to leave the lower level game more 
or less untouched, two separate caps have been placed for targets level 
50 or below, and 51 or above. Heal spells will generate significantly 
less hate for targets below level 51 than those at or above that level.

--- We've also re-evaluated ways that players have to reduce their own 
hate. While spells in place to allow this are OK, the Evade skill 
(possessed by rogues) let them out of their damage too easily. A rogue 
that successfully evaded would immediately drop to a level of hate 
lower than someone who was in the awareness range, but hadn't done 
anything to really upset the creature such as damage it or heal its 
foe. This problem was exacerbated by the increase of the size of the 
hate list implemented with Velious. 

*Tracking*

Tracking now works in full view for all classes that can use it, and 
sports a nifty scroll bar that allows players to see everything on the 
list. In addition, the /trackplayer setting is now saved to the 
eqclient.ini file.

The following options have been put in for Rangers only:

--- /tracksort 
--- /trackfilter 

*/tracksort options beginning with R are reverse order

*Hybrid Casting*

Hybrids that cast spells in combat were taking double penalties at 
higher levels. The casting times of their spells went up, and the 
amount of melee damage they do per second went up. This results is 
having to take longer to cast spells, and losing more damage/second for 
each second taken in casting. To help offset this, Rangers, Paladins 
and Shadowknights casting non-beneficial spells that have casting times 
greater than or equal to 3 seconds, now get a 3 % reduction in casting 
time for each level over 50. 3% at 51, 6% at 52, etc., to 30% at 60. 
Again, this applies only to non-beneficial spells.

***Patch Day***

*General Changes*

-- Doubled the chance gain skill points in skills that are above 200. 
-- Fixed a bug that disallowed casting of the Donal's Breatplate on 
others once casted upon yourself.
-- The spell scrolls for Grim Aura should now all reflect usability by 
SKs
-- Fixed a bug that would allow melee players to open a spellbook via 
/book or alt+b.
-- Merchants will now recognize Iksar as a valid race.
-- New bind locations have been added to three zones in the world - One 
on Antonica and two others on Kunark. NPCs at these locations can fill 
you in on the details. Good hunting.
-- The casting time for four cleric brestplates sporting the "Celestial 
Healing" effect has been increased to one minute. We understand that 
this severely limits the use of that effect and we are currently 
discussing alternate effects to place on those items in the next patch. 
We did, however, need to address the 300pt per tick regen that could be 
placed and kept on the group tank. When we've decided on the new 
affect, it will be applied to those items retroactively. 
-- Numeric skill values will be shown on character skill display for 
skill values over 100. Values under 100 still show the qualitative 
identifiers.
-- Players have expressed concern about accidentally inspecting other 
players. You can now turn on or off your ability to inspect other 
players by typing /inspect. 
-- Those of you with z-axis mouse wheels on your mice may use them over 
the chat window.
-- Fixed "Breath of the Sea". It was mistakenly set to be unresistable.
-- Same-zone evac-type spells will now cause you to reload the current 
zone. This is a necessary step to ensure that you are removed from all 
hatelists and clean up your pet.
-- "Voice Graft" will no longer show the spawn number (Jobaber00) of 
your pet.
-- You will now receive a message when you are being bandaged.
-- The tracking skill cap for Druids has been raised to 125. It was the 
intent for druids to be better at tracking than they were, however 
before the scroll bar, smaller skill numbers were often considered 
better. With the tracking improvements from the last patch, this 
increase was appropriate.
-- Increased the number of hitpoints healed by Celestial Cleansing.

*NPC AI Adjustments*

-- Level 60 players with the taunt skill will now have a chance to 
taunt creatures that are level 60 to 65. Previously, players could only 
taunt creatures below their level.
-- NPCs that are mesmerized or stunned will now only add a very small 
amount of hate when they see you cast beneficial spells on their 
enemies. Prior to this, they would add full hate when they saw you do 
this. This is why NPCs would always jump the cleric after breaking Mez.
-- Fixed a bug that would cause NPCs to add too much "temporary hate" 
when a player would sit down in front of them.
-- The maximum amount of "hate" that an NPC can add when witnessing a 
heal to targets above level 50 has been decreased substantially.
-- Hate from heals is also now calculated at a lesser number than the 
number of hitpoints healed. Previously, healing one hitpoint would 
cause one point of hate. Now, healing 3 hitpoints will cause 2 points 
of hate.

*Velious Music*

Velious subscribers should run the Velious Patch to pick up new mood 
music for some Velious Zones. Let us know what you think of the new 
compositions. 

*EQGems*

A new "mini-game" has been added to the EverQuest client. EQGems is our 
first effort aimed towards allowing people to engage in different 
activities while playing EverQuest. Based upon the success of EQGems, 
we may explore opportunities for other mini-games in the future, even 
some that are multiplayer in and of themselves. Type /gems to play.

*E'ci and The Rathe Movelog*

We will be opening a new server and moving characters from the E'ci and 
The Rathe servers to this new server upon the request of the customer. 
If you choose to move your characters to the new server, please be 
aware that all of your characters on the old server will be moved to 
the new server.

To request to have your characters moved to the new server, all you 
need to do is type "/movelog yes" into the chat window while playing a 
character on that server during the time that the move log is open.

We will be opening the move log for these two servers on Friday, March 
16th, 2001 at 6:00 pm. PST (which is Saturday morning at 2:00 am GMT). 
We will be closing the move log on Sunday, March 18th, 2001 at 11:59 pm 
PST (7:59 am on Monday the 19th GMT). The new, yet unnamed, server 
should be opened some time during the week of March 19th. We'll 
announce the exact date as soon as we can.

There are a few things to keep in mind when choosing to move your 
characters to the new server. The most important thing to keep in mind 
is that character corpses will not be moved with the characters. So it 
is important to make certain that you have looted all of the corpses 
that you want to loot before the characters are moved.

Also, characters names are unique on the new server. Because characters 
will be moving from two separate servers onto the new one, there may be 
cases where two characters with the same name are created on the new 
server. Because character names must be unique, one of the two 
characters will be chosen at random and have an 'x' added to the end of 
their name. If you find that one of your characters has had an 'x' 
tacked onto their name after the move and you would rather have a new 
name, please contact your GM by using the /petition function. The GM 
will help you to change the name of your character.

Guild structures do not follow the characters to the new server. We 
will be unable to reestablish guilds until at least a week has passed 
after the split. On any day after the new server has been up for eight 
days, the guild leader can /petition for a GM to help them reestablish 
the guild. Please do not petition for this before seven days have 
passed, we will not be able to set up your guild before then.

We will not be moving characters back to the old server, so make 
certain that you want to move your characters before you type "/movelog 
yes". And we will not be moving characters for those that fail to 
execute the movelog command during the stated window of opportunity.

*Ever Changing, Evolving, Expanding*

The Warrens:

As part of our two-year celebration, we're pleased to announce the 
release of "The Warrens", a free expansion zone located on Odus. "The 
Warrens" is a low-to-mid level dungeon and the home of the Kobolds on 
Odus. You can patch the Warrens by running the "Optional Patch". 

In addition to filling-out the continent of Odus, "the Warrens" will 
also serve as a platform to try out some of the new ideas brought forth 
by members of the team and the public aimed at addressing some common 
gameplay issues. We would like to see what options might be open to and 
enjoyed by the players in the future.

The first issue addressed in the Warrens is the problem of higher level 
characters competing with lower level characters for loot on lower 
level creatures. To address this issue, in the Warrens, a group that 
"outclasses" a particular foe will not receive any loot that is MAGIC, 
LORE, or NODROP. All other loot will drop. "Outclassing" a foe is 
defined as having a group makeup such that no one in your group 
receives experience from the kill. This can happen if, for instance, 
the foe is "green" to all group members, or if the group makeup is of 
such a wide level range that the system determines the fight was 
unbalanced using regular experience rules.

Any time that an NPC would have dropped special loot and does not due 
to it being outclassed, a message indicating that the combat was 
"trivial" will be displayed to the group. 

As time goes on, we will be implementing new gameplay subsets and 
adjustements in the Warrens. Please be sure to let us know what you 
think!

The Planes:

The Planes of Fear and Hate have been updated as part of our two-year 
celebration. Adventurers in the Plane of Fear will notice that some 
high-level foes are now available. Rewards for former "boss npcs" have 
been moved down to underlings that are roughly as powerful as the old 
bosses were.

The Plane of Hate has also received a large update, but this one also 
includes the opening of a previously undiscovered part of the zone, now 
full high-level expansion-oriented content. Much as with Fear, rewards 
from bosses have been moved. 

Epic Quests:

As part of the Plane updates, we've made several adjustments to Epic 
quests for a number of classes. Previously, questers of many classes 
were put in direct competition with regular non-questing adventurers 
for a few coveted spawns. In these cases, a new step has been added to 
separate the "Epic Encounter" NPCs from the "Epic Quest" NPCs. 

For those who are mid-quest, all quest requirements have remained the 
same. In other words, if you turn the same items into the same NPC, the 
same reward applies. What has changed is that some components may be in 
a different location from where you expect them. It is recommended that 
you check with the last NPC in line or other adventurers to find where 
you need to go next.

***Patch Day***

Along with the big announcements above, today was a patch day as well:

- Fixed a bug that allowed exploitation of the period of time between 
character control being established and loading of character faction 
tables.
- Fixed the Dagger of Frost. Its special item flags were improperly 
removed in the last patch.
- The spell, Mark of Karn, has been enhanced to heal more per hit.
- The effect on the Celestial Elixir Breastplates has been changed to 
the enhanced Mark of Karn. The casting time on these items has also 
been changed to 9 seconds.
- NPCs in Thurgadin will no longer stop traveling when you /hail them.
- Fixed a problem present in Nagafen's Lair and the Plane of Hate that 
caused framerate to drop over time.
- Shift-clicking on a stack of items will cause you to pick up the 
whole stack. This is in addition to CTRL-clicking on a stack, which 
will cause you to pick up one. These both also work for coins now as 
well as items.
- In addition to the above, holding down the shift key while clicking 
the "Sell" button in the vendor screen will cause you to sell the 
entire stack of items if a stack is selected. For example, you can sell 
20 peridots by selecting the stack, and shift-clicking "Sell". I'd 
recommend though that you give them to your neighborhood cleric first 
though :) The ability to buy stacks is on the list for implementation 
in the near future.
- There are a ton of new recipies for trade skill users out there. 
Check your books. 
- There are a bunch of new quests as well.
- It appears that we fixed a bug with the Mend skill that caused it to 
be unavailable for a few seconds after it was supposed to be ready for 
use. Let us know if there are any further problems.
- Foraging items will now yield a message giving you some idea of what you've foraged.

Please remember that the /movelog for the Rathe and E'ci is scheduled 
for this weekend. Please read the message below for details on the 
/movelog.

*A Message From Customer Service*

We regularly receive requests from customers that want their characters 
moved from one server to another, or from one account to another. 
Unfortunately, due to the EverQuest EULA, the number of requests that 
we receive, the desire to maintain stable server communities and 
economies, and other problems associated with character moves, we can 
not move characters across servers or accounts. 

It is important for the integrity of the server that items from a 
server remain on that server. We also feel that it is important that 
characters that have built up a reputation, good or bad, have to live 
with the consequences of their decisions, and are not allowed to 
retreat from that reputation by changing servers.

The only exception to this rule is when we open a Movelog for moving a 
large number of characters to new servers. At no other time will we 
move a character in such a fashion.

***Fan Faire Reminder***

Registration for the San Diego Fan Faire closes on Wednesday, March 
28th, and we are running out of spaces. Once all the spaces are taken, 
we will not be accepting any further registrations (or walk-ins). So if 
you plan to attend sign up before someone else gets your spot. Head 
over to www.everquest.com to register.

*** Patch Day ***

*Spell Changes and Additions*

- A new teleportation spell has been added to the game for both Druids 
and Wizards. These are self-only gate spells to the Dreadlands. These 
spells should be available on the more exclusive spell vendors in 
Norrath.

- Increased the drop rate on some Kunark spells to coincide with the 
narrowing of the creatures carrying those spells as the game evolves.

- Wizards now have access to a new type of spell that only works on 
certain types of target. Generically called 'bane' spells, a few are 
now available in the game. May your quest for such spells be 
successful.

*Item Changes*

- Changed the effects on the Singing Steel Boots and Greaves. After a 
fair amount of concern from players, we have removed the summon food 
and water effects from these items. They have been replaced with 
modified versions of Aria of the Eagles (boots) and Appalling Screech 
(greaves).

- The Incandescent Bracer can now be worn on the wrist rather than the 
waist.

- The Incarnadine Breastplate must now be worn to activate.

- Changed spell effects on Pauldrons of the Fearsome and Fearsome 
Shield to right click and worn to activate.

*Bug Fixes*

- Fixed a bug that was causing some players to zone into the Warrens at 
the wrong location.

- Corrected an error with the Bixie Sword Blade, changing its delay 
from 6 to 16.

- Fixed a bug where Iskar Monks were unable to Feign Death after 
Foraging.

- Kodiaks in the Great Divide are now seen as animals.

- Toxdil, the wandering rogue poison vendor, will now sell to 
characters even when he is away from his home.

*Enhancements*

- Fixed a problem that occurred when players mistyped /guild. Typing 
/guildd in the chat window is the shortcut for typing /guilddelete. 
/guildd now has a confirmation box so that such an error should no 
longer lead to the accidental deletion of a guild. 

- Added /showspelleffects. Using this toggle ('on' or 'off') a player 
can turn on or off the display of particle effects for spells. This 
will only affect spells, not world effects like waterfalls or weapon 
particle effects. This should allow you to turn off many of the effects 
that hamper rendering performance, inducing effects of spells, while 
still being able to see some of the awesome effects, like those on 
certain paladin weapons...

- Added server-side filtering for chat and combat messages. This will 
allow you to turn off guild chat, shouts, auctions, oocs, 'my misses', 
'others misses', 'others hits', 'attacker misses me', PC spells (all 
options), NPC spells and Bard songs (all options) at the server instead 
of at the client. This can reduce that amount of data sent to you over 
your connection, and can help those with slower connections with better 
performance and connectivity.

- Ships will now be announcing their arrival in most zones. They will 
also be announcing their progress to any zone they travel through. Any 
of those zones that they are not currently making announcements in will 
be added in the next patch or two.

- Shift - Left and Shift - Right will now repeat in the chat window. 
This means that when editing what you've typed, you can just hold down 
the Shift and Left Arrow keys and the cursor will move left until it 
reaches the beginning of the line or until you release the keys.

- The spell slot number will now show up in front of the spell name 
when you press Alt to cast a spell using the Alt-Spell Number method.

- View perspective in wolf form has been fixed. First-person view will 
now be on level with the wolf, rather than a few feet above it. At the 
same time, perceiving other players in wolf form will appear to be 
standing on the ground instead of floating a few feet above it.

- Trade skill success and failure messages will be sent to the 
craftsperson's group instead of just the craftsperson, as long as the 
craftsperson is using the proper ingredients. Failure of the craftsman 
to use the proper ingredients will result in no failure message being 
sent.

- In order to prevent a few trade scams, money can no longer be removed 
from a trade window. You will have to cancel the trade and start over 
to adjust the amount of money involved in the trade.

- We're now sending hitpoint updates to the casters of direct damage 
spells no matter how far away they are when the spell lands. This will 
allow those casters that try to stand as far back as possible to get 
updates even when their range indicates that the messages should be 
surpressed.

*Quest*

Several new quests have been added as well, so don't be afraid to talk 
to the folks of Norrath, they might have new information for you.

------------------------------

** New and Changed Features **

- Guild Message of the Day. Guild Officers and Leaders will be able to 
type /guildmotd to set up a Guild Message of the Day (GMotD). From then 
on any time a member of that guild logs in they will see the message 
with the name of the message sender added at the front, so you will 
know who sent the message. Any guild member will also be able to read 
the GMotD by typing just /guildmotd and the message will be displayed 
again. The GMotD will be erased if the server comes down, however. You 
will have to reset the GMotD when the server comes back up.

- /assist changed and improved. It should be much more reliable now. It 
also will target whatever the assisted person has targeted. The 
assisted person does not need to have auto-attack on for /assist to 
work.

- Fixed a problem with /corpse that kept it from working on corpses 
that were too far above or below you.

** Skill Change **

- Foraging changed so that if you are getting the hungry and thirsty 
messages, your next successful forage will always be drink or food. We 
have also decreased the chance of foraging fishing grubs a bit and 
increased the chance that you will forage water.

** Spell Changes **

- Acumen now overwrites See Invisible.

- Translocate now has the proper spell gem.

** Bug Fix **

- Fixed many crash problems for Windows 2000 users. This fix will most 
likely also aid some folks that are not using Windows 2000 that are 
having problems.

** Item Changes **

- Velious racial plate helm quests have been added that will allow you 
to 'trade in' your existing helms for ones with textures. We have 
decided to allow the players (or their characters) to chose whether 
they wish to have the new helmet textures or to continue to use helmets 
that show no graphics.

- Five and ten charge versions of Potions of the Bone Field have been 
added.

- Kilva's Skin of Flame potion has been changed. It no longer has the 
same effect as the Kilva's Blistering Flesh potion.

- Removed the tinting from Dark Forge and Resonant armors. Tinting was 
never really intended to be on those pieces and, frankly, they look 
better without it.

** Miscellaneous Items **

- Reduced the 'bottleneck' for getting Howling Stone keys by increasing 
the availability of one of the quest items.

- Erudite guards will now be much less friendly to Kobolds.

- Vendors are once again selling the Coldain Tanner's Kit.

** 'Combine' container changes **

We've made a change to 'combine' containers. In order to prevent people 
from accidentally destroying items, all containers with a 'combine' 
button will not combine any items that do not form a complete recipe. 
This will be a huge boon to craftspeople all across Norrath. But this 
removes the only drawback to using trade containers as backpacks. Their 
reduced weight and often greater carrying capacity made them more 
desirable as bags, with the compensating risk that you might just lose 
something if you made a mistake.

We will be increasing the weight of portable 'combine' containers 
somewhat. Where some of these containers weighed under 1 pound, they 
will now weigh as much as 4 pounds for the largest sewing kit.

Along with this we are making a change to tailor made backpacks. In 
case you didn't know, most tailor made packs have a built in weight 
reduction of 5%. We are raising that to 10%. We will also be displaying 
the weight reduction of all containers with the information shown on a 
right click.

price. Here's a bit from the press release for details:

---

------------------------------

** Food Changes **

- Food items now have a 'duration'. This means that some food items 
will not sustain a character as long as others, and some items will 
sustain your character longer than they did before.

** Bug Fixes **

- We THINK we've fixed the problem with the Dusty Werebat. This fellow 
has been steadfastly refusing to appear where and when we ask him to. 
We've worked out a deal with his agent, and we think he'll be back to 
work with this patch.

- Corrected an anomaly with hit point bars that occurred when a 
character was healed or damaged by spells. This could be seen, for 
example, when a character was healed and the hit point bar would go up 
and then quickly go back down a bit right afterwards. There was no 
error in the assignment of healing or damage previously, just in the 
way it was being displayed.

- Fixed the visual bracer bug where other people would see a different 
bracer graphic than you would. Now everyone (including the wearer) will 
always see the same bracer texture. If you have two bracers that have a 
different look (one is leather and one is steel, for example), make 
sure that the one you want to show up graphically is on your right 
wrist inventory slot, because this is the one that the game will choose 
to show for you (unless you take off the left one and put it back on, 
which will show the left one, but that is only temporary, and it will 
go back to showing the right one after you zone or reenter the game).

- Fixed zoning problem in Nurga to Droga that caused characters to be 
facing the wrong way when they zoned, often causing confusion that lead 
to accidentally zoning back the way they had come. You should be facing 
the right way when you make that zone transition now.

** Zone and Quest Changes **

- The marauding Tar Goos will no longer be assisted by the Geonids. 
This should make at least one quest more available.

- Grobb should now have a couple of ovens. Hopefully this will allow 
Troll bakers to keep their fellows full of carbs and ready to fight.

- Fixed a bug that occurred when selling stacks of items. Previously, 
if you had 4 bat wings and sold them one by one to the merchant, the 
merchant would have 4 bat wings for you to buy, but if you sold all 
four at once to the merchant he would only have one for you to buy. Now 
he will have 4 in either case.

- We have increased the spawn rate of Venril Sathir and his skeletal 
remains. Please note that only Rangers and Druids will be able to 
trigger the spawn for the skeletal remains, and those remains will only 
be dropping items for those epic quests. Hopefully these changes will 
dramatically reduce the competition and resentment over this spawn.

- We have reduced resistances to some spell types on some NPCs in Sky 
Shrine and the Tower of Frozen Shadow. This is the beginning of our 
overview of the resistances of NPCs in Velious.

** Improved and New Features **

- When you /consent someone it will give them the ability to drag all 
of your corpses.

- You can now buy stacks of combinable items (such as rations, water, 
etc...) from merchants. It works the same way as sell in that you can 
hold down shift to buy a full stack and control to buy just one item.

- Added the ability to change the color of all windows at one time with 
/wincolor (all windows that can be changed, that is). You can now use 
/wincolor ALL 0 0 100 2, for example, instead of having to set each 
window separately.

- Right-clicking items while looting will 'auto-equip' them. This will 
work just as if you had picked the items up and dropped them onto the 
'auto-equip' area of your character profile. So if there is already a 
piece of equipment on your character in the spot where the looted item 
would normally go, it will drop into your inventory, if you have room 
for it.

- The tab key will no longer toggle between you and your last target 
when the chat bar is up. When the chat bar is open the tab key will 
take you through the list of your most recent /tell names or /reply 
names. When the chat bar is closed the tab key will switch you between 
yourself and your last target.

- /assist has an added parameter. /assist on and /assist off will 
determine whether or not your character auto-attacks when you use 
/assist. So if you type /assist off, from that time forward using 
/assist will NOT engage your character's auto-attack. This change will 
be persistent, so it will remain as you left it when you log out. 
/assist also now has a range of 200 feet.

- The destroy confirmation requestor now shows the name of the item you 
are trying to destroy, or it just says money if you are destroying 
coins. This should greatly reduce the chance of accidentally deleting 
the wrong item. PLEASE read the text in the destroy confirmation box to 
be certain that you are destroying the right item before choosing to 
destroy it.

- Hailing Player Character will now say 'Hail Playername', rather than 
just 'hail'.

- Added /charinfo command. Currently this command only reports the zone 
where the current character is bound. We may add further information as 
things progress.

- You will now see how much damage your character has taken when he is 
hit by a spell that causes instant damage (DOT damage is not reported).

** Item Changes **

- We've made a change to the Red Scabbard that should relieve most of 
the problems warriors were having with their epic weapon occasionally 
disappearing during conversion between the two-handed weapon and the 
two one-handed weapons. What will happen now is rather simple. The very 
next time you use the container to combine the weapons (or break them 
apart), the old scabbard will disappear and a new one will replace it.

THE NEW SCABBARD AND THE SWORDS WILL APPEAR ON YOUR CURSOR, rather than 
in your inventory. So once you have combined them, make sure to place 
them in your inventory. And don't panic, the items didn't disappear. :) 
But also MAKE CERTAIN THAT YOU HAVE ROOM IN YOUR INVENTORY FOR ALL 
THREE ITEMS (the two swords and the scabbard, which is a container and 
needs to be able to fit into your main inventory). If you end up with a 
No-Drop container on your cursor with no place to put it in your 
inventory, you will have a problem...

Also, right now the new scabbard is a little bugged. Right now you 
won't be able to open the new scabbard until you camp out once after it 
is created. We're working on fixing that bug. We decided to make this 
change even with this small bug to help relieve everyone of the 
problems with the old scabbard.

This new scabbard will have a special ability. It will be able to 
recreate the epic weapons if you have lost them. Simply place a Sword 
of Runes (summoned by a Magician) into the scabbard and hit the combine 
button. The scabbard will convert the temporary power of the Sword of 
Runes into the permanent epic sword.

Customer Service WILL NOT be replacing the old scabbards with the new 
ones. That will be done by the game itself once you have completed the 
quest and combined the swords for the first time.

- Changed the size of the Weighted Axe from Tiny to Large (after all, 
it's a big two-handed axe...). If you have one in a bag now, be aware 
that it probably won't fit back into that bag again once you take it 
out.

- No Rent Items will no longer be immediately deleted from your 
character inventory upon disconnection with the server. If you are 
disconnected from the servers, or even if you log out, your No Rent 
items (such as summoned food and water) will remain on your character 
as long as you log back to that character within 30 minutes. After 
thirty minutes those No Rent items will be deleted. There may be some 
extreme cases beyond our control (such as hardware failures) where No 
Rent items will not be on your character even if you log back in within 
the 30 minute timeframe. No reimbursement will be given for No Rent 
items lost in this manner.

- Grand Master Wrist Wraps have been fixed and should now create the 
"Pouch of Quellios" as intended. If you have one of these items and it 
still does not work, please contact a GM using /petition and ask them 
to switch yours for a new one.

- Snow Storm Mask should now function properly.

- The Ring of the Frozen Flame should now be working properly.

- The slow effect on the Willsapper proc has been reduced.

- The weight of Skewers has been increase to a weight of 3.

- Velious Monk armor appearances have been changed. If you're wearing 
these items, you probably already noticed this, but we thought we'd 
announce it anyway. New textures will be showing on the Plane of Growth 
dropped armors and on the questable armors. Because the Velious 
textures can be a strain on some systems, the textures for these new 
armors will not be loaded by default by the game. If you want to see 
the new textures you will have to edit your EQClient.ini and change the 
line LoadArmor23=FALSE (the default) to LoadArmor23=TRUE.

** Trade Skill Changes **

- Bards that worship Sol Ro will now be able to wear the Imbued jewelry 
made for their god. For those that not only sing around the campfire, 
but sing about the campfire!

- 'World' Trade Containers (those that are stationary) have been fixed. 
Previously when a character tried to combine items in a world container 
that did not match a recipe, the items would seem to disappear. But if 
the character closed and reopened the container, the items were still 
in it. Those items should no longer seem to disappear.

- The speed of Selo's Song of Travel, the effect of the Singing Steel 
Chestplate has been increased a little.

** Spell Changes **

- Removed Gem component from the following spells. They will now only 
require the metal components. These are the Enchant spells for making 
cultural armor.

Enchant Velium
Enchant Mithril
Enchant Adamantite
Enchant Steel
Enchant Brellium

- Changed the spell component for the following Magician spells from 
Lapis Lazuli to Malachite. They now use the same reagent as every other 
Magician pet spell.

Minor Summoning: Earth 
Minor Summoning: Water 
Minor Summoning: Fire
Minor Summoning: Air
Elemental: Earth
Elemental: Water
Elemental: Fire
Elemental: Air

- Added Casting Text to the Following spells (the messages in brackets 
will now appear upon a successful use of the spell):

Panic Animal (soandso flees in a state of total panic!)
Terrorize Animal (soandso runs away in terror!)
Repulse Animal (soandso is utterly repulsed!)
Acumen (soandso's eyes tingle)

- Cannibalize IV now exists. This spell is now available in Velious.

- Cannibalize II and III have had their effects improved. They now 
return more mana to the caster than they did before.

** Class Specific Changes **

- Monk weight allowance has been increased. Every 15 levels monks will 
get an extra 1 stone weight allowance. The post 50 weight allowance has 
also been increased by 2 stone.

Level 15, Limit 15
Level 30, Limit 16
Level 45, Limit 17
Level 51, Limit 18
Level 55, Limit 20
Level 60, Limit 24

- Disarmed traps will remain disarmed for a somewhat longer time than 
before to allow larger groups to get past the traps before they go off.

April 18, 2001  Luclin Announced - Press Release
------------------------------

SONY ONLINE ENTERTAINMENT EXPANDS EVERQUEST(r) UNIVERSE WITH 
"EVERQUEST(r): SHADOWS OF LUCLIN(tm)"

- Massive Additions in Store for SOE's Premier Role-Playing Game--

SAN DIEGO, CA - April 18, 2001 - Sony Online Entertainment announced 
today its new expansion pack, "EverQuest: Shadows of Luclin" for the 
Internet's most popular role-playing game, "EverQuest(r)." The new 
expansion pack will introduce EverQuest fans to an enchanting moonscape 
packed with new adventure zones, new items, creatures and spells, a new 
playable character class and more. Supported by a complete graphic 
overhaul, "Shadows of Luclin" will allow EverQuest players to witness 
their world in unprecedented splendor.

"'Shadows of Luclin' will give EQ fans a beautiful uncharted territory 
to explore," states Jeff Butler, Producer, Sony Online Entertainment. 
"Whether you're a devoted long-term fan looking for new challenges or 
just discovering online gaming for the first time, 'Shadows of Luclin' 
is filled with enough captivating adventures to support all levels of 
EverQuest players."

"The Shadows of Luclin" takes voyagers to a satellite hovering 
ominously above the world of Norrath. An area of great mystery, magic, 
and perplexity, Luclin is divided into a land of light, ruled by 
Discord, and a land of shadow, ruled by Order. Each side of this 
amazing world will present many new secrets, treasures and unique 
monsters.

"Shadows of Luclin" key features:

* New adventure zones, including a new starting city
* All new, highly detailed player-character models
* Massively enhanced 3D graphics engine
* An all-new player character race
* Challenging new quests, items to trade and sell, NPCs and more

"EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin" is due to ship in Q4 2001. For more 
information visit the official Shadows of Luclin Website at 
http://www.everquest.com/luclin.

Continuing to grow with top-selling expansions "The Ruins of Kunark
(tm)" and "The Scars of Velious(tm)," "EverQuest" proves to be the 
largest fantasy world ever created online. During peak periods, more 
than 88,000 adventurers and dragon slayers have explored the world of 
Norrath simultaneously. The active global EverQuest subscriber base is 
comprised of players from various countries throughout the "real" 
world, including the U.S., England, Canada, Japan, Taiwan, Korea, Saudi 
Arabia, France, Italy and Australia.

** PvP changes **

We have made the first of our upcoming changes to the PvP aspects of 
EverQuest:

- Consider: /Consider will only have three results when used to 
consider a Player Character. The character will show as 'green' if he 
is below the range that allows you to attack him. The character will 
show as 'white/black' if he is within your ability to attack. And the 
character will show as 'red' if he is above your range. This will only 
take effect on PvP servers.

- Sanctuary Levels: Characters below level six will not be able to 
engage in PvP combat, unless they take part in a Guild War, duel or use 
the Arena. This will, obviously, only take place on PvP servers.

- De-Leveling: Characters that lose levels will only retain the combat 
skills of a character two levels higher. This means that if a character 
of level 10 somehow loses 5 levels, that character will only have 
skills that would be available to a 7th level character. This change 
will apply to all servers (it has to, code-wise). So the two level 
buffer is there to make certain that people that lose levels during 
normal gameplay will be minimally affected (hopefully not affected at 
all), while those that purposefully lose levels with the intent of 
causing other players grief will find themselves at no great advantage.

These are the first of the things that we plan to. We are taking a 
careful, step-by-step approach to changes whenever we can, and we have 
other changes planned for upcoming patches.

** Quest Changes **

- We've made a change to the Velious armor quests. The folks in Kael 
and in Skyshrine that give out rewards for these quests are now being 
stricter about who they will reward quest items to. You will have to be 
considered an 'ally' (see Features section below) by these NPCs in 
order to be able to complete these quests. If you are doing quests for 
the Coldain, however, they are somewhat less picky, and they only 
require that they consider you 'kindly' to reward you for your labors.

- The Black Silk Cape will now drop more frequently.

** Bug Fixes **

- Attacking with a two-handed piercing weapon will now 'gray-out' the 
attack button as it should.

- Text that once read: "You cannot remove this affect." now reads "You 
cannot remove this effect." Changed by popular demand... :)

- Food Emotes: Forcing your character to eat by right clicking food 
will now properly display the appropriate emote to those in the area.

- Fixed a problem that often made it difficult to loot really large 
NPCs.


** Item Changes **

- The Shield of Tsunami can now be equipped in the secondary slot.

- Quivers now reduce the delay time on bows, the better the quiver the 
faster your bow. We will not be listing the speed increase a quiver 
will give your bow, but you can tell the good quivers by their ability 
to reduce the weight of your arrows (better-made or magical quivers 
have this property).

- The Ivory Handled Falchion should now 'proc' without telling you that 
it is out of charges. You may need to contact your GM to replace the 
item with a new version if it is still acting strangely.

- The Opal Bracelet is now a wrist item, not a finger item. Be aware, 
once you remove it from your finger, it will not go back onto that 
finger, it will only fit on your wrists, as it should.

- The Large Dragonbone Shard will no longer appear to be a Staff of the 
Gathering.

- The Ring of Levitation will now poof when all the charges are used 
up, and should display the correct number of charges.

- The Priceless Velium Reinforced Bow now has a range of 200 instead of 
a range of 0.

- The Refined Mithril Blade should now be equipable in both primary and 
secondary slots.

- The Unicorn Horn should now have a graphic.

- The Hammer of Flattening has been changed from tiny to large. This 
might cause you a little reorganization in your inventory.

- Runebranded Stone Buckler is now labeled as a shield and can be used 
to bash.

- The Ring of Pureblood is now a finger item, not a waist item.

** Spell Changes and Additions **

- Translocation spells: Five new Wizard 'push' spells have been added 
(Translocate: Fay, Tox, North, Combine and Group). Translocate spells 
send the group to the location, while the Wizard remains behind. 
Translocate Group sends everyone in the group (except the Wizard) to 
their own bind points. Translocate Group can be found on NPCs in 
Velious (and they won't give them up easily). The others are available 
on an exclusive vendor. All Translocate spells (even the original 
Translocate) have confirmation boxes that must be accepted before the 
target will be sent. And Wizards can no longer Translocate themselves.

- Some lower 39th and 44th level Velious spells have had their drop 
rates increased.

- GM Resurrection has had it's name changed from ResurrectionGM to 
Customer Service Resurrection so that players will be able to better 
tell when they are getting a resurrection from the GM staff. GM 
resurrection will no longer have Res effects, and will leave the newly 
Ressed with full Hit Points and Mana.

- Divine Aura and spells of that type (Divine Aura - cleric, Divine 
Barrier - cleric, Kazumi's Note of Preservation - bard, Harmshield - 
necromancer, Quivering Veil of Xarn - necromancer) will now prevent the 
caster from being stunned when hit for their duration.

- The Eye of Zomm series of spells will no longer work in Kedge Keep. 
This change was made to prevent an exploit.

** Feature Additions and Changes **

- Looting text has been changed. You will now see a -- before and after 
any loot messages. This has been changed primarily to help prevent any 
fake looting messages from being thought of as real.

- When you loot an item, you will receive a text message telling you 
what you have just looted.

- Expanded Friends List: The Friends List will now hold 30 character 
names. And each character has its own friends list. You can find and 
edit this list with a text editor, if you need to, outside the game. 
You can locate the text files in your EverQuest directory. The files 
will look like this: _<#>.ini. The default Friends List for existing 
and new characters will be your old Friends List.

- The destroy or drop item confirmation box will now close if you 
accidentally pick up another item while they are open. This should 
prevent accidentally deleting or dropping the wrong item.

- When selling to a merchant, you can no longer sell items that are 
inside a container by having the container selected and clicking the 
sell button. The merchant will tell you that you need to empty the 
container before the merchant will buy it. This should prevent folks 
from accidentally selling items that they did not know were in those 
containers.

- You can now move items around inside containers that are in the bank.

- There is a new /consider message: "regards you as an ally". This is 
the highest level of friendliness that an NPC will register using the 
/consider command. The faction required to reach this rating is 
significantly higher than 'warmly'.

** Fan Faire **

The Fan Faire in Minneapolis is half way sold out. There are just over 
two more weeks left to register so don't delay! For each of these 
events, we get countless e-mails asking if there is any space available 
after we have sold out... and then it is too late! So don't wait until 
registration is closed! Register now and be sure your spot is reserved!

** Guild Wipe for Guilds without enough members **

On May 15th we will be performing another servers-wide guild wipe for 
any guild with less than ten members. Remember, it is always a 
requirement to have ten members in your guild. These ten members must 
all be characters from separate accounts (only one member from each 
account will be counted for the ten member total). So if your guild 
does not have ten members on Tuesday, May 15th, it will be deleted.

We're sorry for being so harsh about this rule, but there is a distinct 
limit to the number of guilds that we can support, and the rules for 
maintenance of a guild are clear.

** Important announcement about the next patch **

Our next patch is planned for May 30th, probably some time in the wee 
morning hours here on the West Coast.

The important part of the message is not that, though. It's this:

Due to some of the things we are going to be doing, there is a small 
chance that some corpses might disappear during the patch. GMs will 
have the ability to verify any corpses that are lost. That means that 
they can help you get them back if you do indeed lose one. It also 
means that I should remind everyone that attempting to scam a GM about 
a lost corpse could mean banning.

** IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU PETITION TO HAVE A MISSING CORPSE **
** PROBLEM ADDRESSED WITHIN 5 DAYS OF THE PATCH! **

We will not be recovering corpses that might be lost after that time. 
In fact, it would be best for you to petition immediately if you have a 
problem. Don't wait. If you are worried about a corpse that you were 
unable to deal with before the patch, then please log in an check on it 
right away after the patch.

So please make certain that you have as many of your corpses cleaned up 
as possible before the next patch. We're not expecting a lot of corpses 
to disappear, but the fewer lying around, the less chance of them 
disappearing.

Thanks.

** Updated EQManual_Supplement **

The EQManual_Supplement.doc and EQManual_Suppliment.txt have been 
updated. The majority of the updates occurred in the description of the 
EQclient.ini file and the descriptions of the in-game "slash" commands. 
This document also includes things like a listing of the emotes 
available, instructions for changing windows and text colors, and other 
additions to the original manual, and is a good first source for 
EverQuest information and help.

*** Important Reminder ***

Due to some of the things we are going to be doing, there is a small 
chance that some corpses might disappear during the patch. GMs will 
have the ability to verify any corpses that are lost. That means that 
they can help you get them back if you do indeed lose one. It is also

*** Patch Message ***

** Zone Changes **

- Runnyeye has been changed. Something is up in Goblin land...


** Spell and Song Changes and Bug Fixes **

- We've been fixing holes in the spell stacking code. For the most part 
the changes fix bugs that allowed tricks to get spells to stack that 
were never intended to stack.

- Increased duration on Bard Charm songs to 18 seconds from 12 seconds.

- Fixed the Spell Scroll for Imbue Amber so that Erudite Clerics of 
Cazic Thule can scribe it.

- The casting messages for Necromancer pet summoning spells have been 
changed to be more appropriate.

** Features and Interface Changes **

- The variable %t will now work with /assist. So you can use /assist %t 
if you wish. Though it should have exactly the same effect as /assist 
without the %t.

- %r returns "corpse" for corpses and "NPC" for targeted NPCs.

- Sense traps failure message text color has been changed to user color 
15 (same as other skill messages). The success message was already set 
to user color 15.

- Ignore Lists now work the same way that the Friends List does. It has 
been expanded to 30 names per character per server. The new ignore list 
is stored in the same ini file as the friends list _<#>.ini). The first 
time a character is created or loaded after the patch their new ignore 
list will be a copy of the old ignore list, but will from then on be 
unique to the character.

- The Alt key now works in several new situations. It will now show 
item names when in the trade window. Because the trade items of the 
local player and the trading partner are so close together, the item 
names of the trading partner will always show up unless the player 
positions their mouse pointer over the local player part of the trade 
window, which will cause the game to only show the local player's trade 
item names.

- The Alt key will show item names for items in your bank.

- The Alt key will also pop up names for merchant items and corpse 
items when you hold it down in merchant mode or loot mode.

- The Alt key will even pop up names for items in open containers when 
held down and the mouse cursor is over the open container window (they 
don't show up otherwise).

- The client will now automatically reject a /duel request from any 
player that is on your /ignore list. Some players were using this to 
annoy players that had ignored them.

- You also will no longer see /consent messages from people that are on 
your /ignore list (this was also something people were doing to annoy 
people that had ignored them).

- /who GUILD (and the GUILD must be in caps) will now show you the 
members of your guild in your zone. You can also specify a guild name, 
such as /who "Irontoe Brigade".

- /safelock command added. /safelock will lock the EverQuest interface 
(mostly just mouse clicks, keyboard commands/movement, and most slash 
commands) with the password that you supply to the command. You must 
use this command a second time, supplying the same password, to unlock 
the interface. Passwords are NOT case-sensitive. So to lock your 
interface, you would type /safelock password. You would do the same to 
unlock it. REMEMBER: If you forget what password you typed, you will 
need to reboot your machine.

** Item Changes **

- All the shields in the game that have the Ribcage graphic should now 
also have the ribcage icon when they are in your inventory.

- Tinkered Watchman helm should show up now.

- Ring of Pureblood is now equipable only on your fingers instead of 
your waist.

- Grand Master's Leg Wraps and Fists of the Grand Master are now No-
Drop. They were intended to be No-Drop when they were created. 

- Peacekeeper Staff and the Bug Collection box are no longer equipable. 
There are problems that can arise when containers can be equipped, so 
we had to disable that for these items.

- Sewing Kits: No existing sewing kits are being changed with this 
patch. But from now on, kits sold on vendors will be somewhat 
different. Large Sewing Kits will have 8 slots. Deluxe Sewing Kits will 
have 10 slots and weight slightly more than the Large Sewing Kit.

- Changed the color of the Kael SK quest armor from a very pretty blue-
green to a more appropriate reddish-gray.

** Other Stuff **

- Changed the spelling of Troubador to Troubadour for the 55th level 
bard title. :)

- King Tormax's spawn rate has been adjusted to be more in line with 
that of his counterparts in Velious. This is not the sort of thing that 
we will usually announce, as spawn times and things of that nature are 
part of the dynamic content of EverQuest. We're announcing this, 
however, to help avoid some confusion.

*** Patch Addendum ***

This evening we put in another patch to correct some issues that arose 
with the patch yesterday. The changes implemented include some that 
weren't announced previously:

- Resist-debuffs will do 1.5 times their normal value for PvP 
encounters. In other words, if the spell did -60MR in PvP before, it 
does -90MR in PvP now. PvE (combat versus NPCs) remains unaffected.
- Faction-loss for PvP kills on Vallon and Tallon now only occur 
against factions within the hometown of the person killed. In other 
words, if you kill an Erudite in Erudin, you will only lose faction 
with the factions in Erudin, not the factions in Paineel.
- Turning in the Tomb of Order and Discord will have no effect on 
Vallon and Tallon.
- On all PvP servers, only the person who gets the killing-blow in PvP 
combat will have looting rights. We would prefer to implement some sort 
of "majority damage" logic however this should solve most of the issues 
associated with uninvolved players "ninja-looting" the loser in PvP 
encounters.

anything that would normally be announced.

- The EverQuest Team

June 27, 2001  3:00 am
------------------------------

** Gameplay Changes **

- Aggro Changes: We've made an adjustment to the way that NPCs choose 
their targets. It's a rather simple change, one that makes a lot of 
sense. But we want you to be aware of it so that it won't surprise you 
too much, and so that you won't think that it is a bug. NPCs are now 
much more aware of the vulnerability (or, more precisely, the 
invulnerability) of their targets. NPCs will now be very unlikely to 
waste their time attacking a target that they can't harm.

- Spell and Item Interruption: Ducking will now interrupt a spell 
instantly. You will no longer be able to sit while using items or 
casting spells. This will not affect bard songs, which will still work 
as they always have, but will affect all items, even those with song-
like effects.

** Spell Changes **

- Skin Like Nature and Natureskin should stack with more spells now 
(though not with each other).

- Aegolism can now be clicked off.

- Imbue Ivory has had its casting level lowered to 29.

- Shard of the Core will be tradable now.

- Shroud of Hate and Visions of Grandeur should stack properly now.

- Several new Translocation spells have been added.

- Call of the Hero will no longer remove the target from NPCs' 
hatelists if the target is not summoned far enough.

- Egress will now work indoors.

- Wind of the North, Wind of the South, Markar's Relocation and 
Tishan's Relocation have had their additional restrictions removed, and 
can now be cast from any zone where other similar spells can be cast.

- Summon Companion can now be used by Necromancers, Shamans, 
Enchanters, Shadowknights in addition to Magicians.

- Deadeye should now stack with Dead Man Floating, but should not stack 
with Acumen.

- Plainsight will now stack with Dead Man Floating, but not with 
Acumen.

- The Great Divide portal spells are now 39th level instead of 44th 
level.

- Spirit of the Oak will no longer be overwritten by any beneficial 
spells.

- Paralyzing Poison spells should no longer be broken by direct damage 
spells.

- Hsagra's Wrath and Porlos' Fury now have a 5 second recast delay.

** Item Changes **

- The effect on the 10th ring should have fewer stacking conflicts with 
haste buffs. 

- The effect of the Monk epic, Celestial Tranquility, will stack with 
the higher end haste spells. Keep in mind - the highest haste will 
always win out. This means that the spells will stack, the haste 
components will not.

- Speed of the Shissar has had its duration increased from 20 minutes 
to 30 minutes. This effect should no longer conflict with Call of 
Earth.

- Bone Ring of Condemnation will no longer be usable in the secondary 
slot, it will only be wearable on the finger.

- Druid Skyshrine Quest armor has had a color change so that it will 
look more unique.

- Circlet of Shadow will no longer drop in-game. The Circlet of 
Shadows, can now be found in its place. This item differs from the 
original only in that it has a five-second casting time. Existing 
Circlets of Shadow will retain the same functionality as before, though 
we may change existing Circlets at some future date.

** Quest Changes **

- King Tormax is now a little more particular about who he gives quests 
to.

- The Iksar Shaman 6th Skull/cudgel quest should be working now. 

- Rumor has it that there is a new source for green dragon scales in 
Norrath.

** PvP Changes **

- If you go link dead on a PvP server and are killed you can still be 
looted.

- When a player becomes invisible (or hides successfully) every other 
player that had them targeted will lose their target. This is true for 
all servers, but has the greatest implications on PvP servers. The use 
of spells that allow you to see through invisibility will prevent you 
from losing your target if that target hides or goes invisible.

- Faction hits on Rallos Zek: Killing a person in one of his or her 
home cities will cause a faction hit with residents of that city.

** Miscellaneous **

- We've addressed a lot of spelling and grammatical errors over the 
past few weeks. For example we have corrected all misspellings of 
"deity" in messages to the player, changed Cantana to Cantata and 
others.

- The 'Fab Four' in Dagnor's Cauldron will no longer assist Undertow 
Skeletons.

- Instill Doubt/Intimidation can no longer be used while sitting, and 
sitting after starting it will cancel it.

- Mastery of language skills now occurs at 100, not at 101. This was a 
problem for masters of a language, since language skills could not go 
over 100.

- The messages for eating and drinking now say "Chomp... Chomp," or 
"Glug... Glug..." so that they can't be copied with emotes.

- Helms on Barbarians, Trolls, and Ogres should no longer block the 
first person view when in combat. 

- Sirens Grotto has been changed a bit. It should be a more interesting 
zone now.

** NOTE **

Boisterous shouts can be heard across the lands as carriers herald the 
arrival of the latest volume of their city's newspapers. Citizens rush 
to get a copy of these publications to read the featured articles, 
latest gossip, and community news for their home town.

** Bug Fixes **

- The "NPC unerringly sticks on pet" AI bug implemented in the last 
patch has been fixed. This resolves a bug that occurred a short while 
ago that would cause pets to be the focus for most attacks by NPCs.

- Fixed the animation problem where an animation played on the upper 
body would get stuck. This could be seen by starting to cast a spell 
and then walking forward while it was playing the casting animation.

- Fixed a bug that wouldn't allow a player to target an invisible PC or 
NPC with the F7 or F8 keys even if they had See Invisible up.

- Stacking issues with 'change form' type spells have been corrected. 
Lich and Clarity will no longer stack, nor will Spirit of Wolf and Wolf 
Form.

- The bug with screenshots that some people experienced when using 32-
bit color mode should be fixed.

** Item and Vendor Adjustments **

- Changed the forged Antonian Javelins to be stackable.

- Gnome Skin Sleeves are now droppable and rentable.

- Spiderling and Spider Silks are now stackable

- Spider Legs are now stackable.

- Tarnished weapons worth slightly more to the vendors than the rusty 
ones.

- Reduced the weight of the monk only Black Pantherskin armor.

- All Sheets of metal and Folded Sheets of metal are now stackable.

- Rangers will now be able to wear Girdle of Reflection

- There is now a vendor in Felwithe that sells the Enchant Ores series 
of enchanter spells.

** Zone and Quest Changes **

- The Crazed Ghouls should be less of a problem in Unrest.

- The Monk red headband quest should now be available again.

- We've added a few more Yew Leaf spawns.

- Reevaluated the values of the various fish fillets. All fish vendors 
should return to normal, but they won't be paying as well for certain 
fishy items. This resolves a problem that was created with the 
increased value of player made food items all over Norrath. Some of 
food items were made too valuable, and merchants were complaining to 
their union leaders...

- The Smite scroll no longer lists Enchanters as a class that can use 
it.

- Barrier of Force will now stack with Protection of the Glades.
- Manaskin and Protection of the Glades will now stack.

- There are no faction hits for killing half-elves in any city.
- If an Erudite of Paineel is killed in Paineel the killer takes a 
faction hit (existing rule).
- If an Erudite of Erudin is killed in Erudin the killer takes a 
faction hit (new rule).
- Bards can't cast harmful spells on boats.
- If a character kills a higher level character, the higher level 
character will always lose experience. This is in addition to the fact 
that any player killed within the + or - 5 level range will lose 
experience.
- Goods and Neutrals will now be able to turn in Greater Insignias for 
a Magician only summon corpse potion usable only at levels over 45th.
- Characters under level 6 will no longer be immune to PvP in many 
adventure zones. Players will be notified when they enter such zones.

** Misc. Changes **

- /target playername will now work on invisible targets as long as the 
character doing the targeting has the ability to see invisible.

** NOTE **

Boisterous shouts can be heard across the lands as carriers herald the 
arrival of the latest volume of their city's newspapers. Citizens rush

- Fixed a bug that was not allowing some NPCs in Kael to see invisible 
creatures as they should.
- Restored "charmability" of most NPCs (merchants will remain

Miscellaneous Changes.


** Item Changes **

- Staff of Temperate Flux has been changed to main hand only.
- Ring of Frost Spiders can now be worn.
- Robe of the Seacaller should now be equipable.

** Trade Skill Changes **

- Imbued Field Plate Boots should be working properly now.

** Sullon Zek Changes **

- Changed the way resists are calculated when a Player Character casts 
a spell on another Player Character on Sullon Zek. Resist modifiers 
based on level will now be more smoothly distributed and will allow 
lower level characters a slightly better chance to land spells on 
higher level characters. At the same time giving lower level characters 
a slightly better chance to resist spells cast on them by higher level 
characters.
- Characters below 6th level cannot be pick pocketed in any zone.
- Guards have a better chance of aggro'ing a rogue that fails at 
picking pockets near guards.

** Miscellaneous Changes **

- Fixed a recently introduced combat AI bug that caused NPCs to focus 
unduly on attacking pets rather than PCs
- Added a few crowns to the list of items that can be traded in for new 
crowns with new textures. The same NPCs that were interested in trading 
out your helms will now trade your crowns. Please keep in mind that 
they will not be trading them back to you. Once you get the new look 
it's yours to keep, even if it clashes with your favorite eye shadow.

- Fixed the problem that was causing zones to crash in some instances.

for a sound event between the splash and character-select screens.

** Item Change **

- The Green Flower should be working again.

** Spell Change **

- Fixed a stacking bug that allowed multiple Levitation buffs to stack.

** Sullon Zek Changes **

- The Resist code changes we made with the last patch should be working 
properly now. Here is the text about that change:

"Changed the way resists are calculated when a Player Character casts a 
spell on another Player Character on Sullon Zek. Resist modifiers based 
on level will now be more smoothly distributed and will allow lower 
level characters a slightly better chance to land spells on higher 
level characters. At the same time giving lower level characters a 
slightly better chance to resist spells cast on them by higher level 
characters."

- Cancel Magic spells should now work across teams.

- Characters should no longer disappear when Mesmerized or stunned.

Located on the small continent of Odus, the Stonebrunt Mountains are 
rich with vegetation and distinctive hills that give way to the 
towering Mount Klaw; the largest mountain in Odus and home to the 
Kerran village of Kejeka. The zone of Stonebrunt is designed to be a 
mid-level, outdoor zone similar in scope and scale to the Lake of Ill 
Omen on Kunark, which has proven to be a very popular zone in 
EverQuest.

September 11, 2001  3:00 am

** Spell Changes **

- Changed all enchanter mesmerization spells so that they overwrite 
Screaming Terror

- Changed Shaman epic effect (Curse of the Spirits) so that it would 
not conflict with certain Damage over Time spells.

- The Emissary of Thule Necromancer pet is now immune to fear

- Beneficial buffs that don't have an ability drain component on them 
can now be clicked off.

** Miscellaneous Updates **

- The server selection screen now only gives information on whether or 
not a server is up instead of providing player counts. In addition, the 
"count" option on the /who command has been restricted to internal 
personnel. Servers on the server selection screen are still ordered 
from least-populated to most populated in order to assist players in 
choosing the least populated server.

- Harla Dar has been repaired (this happened sometime earlier than 
today, but we wanted you to know).

- Reactivated broken zone line between Qeynos to the Sewers. A dead 
halfling was stuck in the drainpipe and has been removed.

- Fixed a long-standing bug that was causing Feign Death to fail when 
several characters were on the NPC's hate list along with the character 
using Feign Death. We'd like to extend much thanks to the monk 
community who helped us track this one down. Also fixed a problem with 
the monk's 'Block' skill which inadvertantly was recapped at a lower 
than normal skill level in recent months. Kudos to "Faned" of the 
"Monkly Business" bulletin board who brow-beat Gordon with the facts 
until he gave in and looked at the code :)

- As announced earlier this week, the Belt of the Cenobite was made 
useable by some inappropriate classes/races in the last patch. This has 
been corrected.

- Several quest components in zones with the Trivial Loot Code will now 
be lootable regardless of level.

September 11, 2001  Terrorist Attack Response
------------------------------

"The staff of Sony Online Entertainment wish to extend their 
condolences and prayers to the victims, and the families of the 
victims, lost in today’s horrific events. We share in your grief during 
these difficult times."

The quote from our front page expresses how we all feel here in the 
office. I only want to extend my personal sympathies to all the 
families that this has touched.

We have received many letters, and I want to thank you all for sending 
them in. It's obvious that we will all be different people from here 
forward. If I don't dwell on this in my responses here it is only 
because I know that none of us will forget what has happened, and that 
you come here for entertainment not reminders of tragedy.

Sony Online Entertainment, is asking for your help in locating someone 
involved in the recent terror:

Sony Online Entertainment needs your help in locating Gregory Trost. 
Gregory is a nephew of an SOE employee and his last known location was 
the 86th floor of Tower Two in the World Trade Center. With the tragic 
events that took place on September 11, the Trost family is anxious for 
any information regarding Gregory. If you have any information on 
Gregory's whereabouts, please contact Sony Online Entertainment at this 
special address. greginfo@station.sony.com

[Editor Note: Gregory Trost was later found to be among the nearly 3000 
people killed in the World Trade Center disaster.]

** Spell Changes **

- We have removed the changes to bard song stacking that were made with 
the recent emergency patch. We will be reviewing those changes for 
possible update in a future patch.

** Item Changes **

- The Shaman Epic effect has been returned to its previous effect (and 
it should conflict with fewer Damage over Time spells, as was the 
intention for the change made last patch).

** Quest Changes **

- Ivory Sky Diamond is now dropping as it should.

- Fixed an error in a Stonebrunt quest where an NPC was handing out the 
wrong reward.

** Miscellaneous **

- Added some code that might fix a bug with female hair and Erudite 
hoods that caused them to fail to appear sometimes when a helmet was 
removed. This would cause some characters to look as though the back of 
their head was missing at times.

- Mouselook will now work a little differently when in the first two 
third-person camera modes (overhead and chase). They will work 
similarly to first-person mouselook (i.e. your character's heading will 
change when you move the mouse left or right, the left and right 
movement keys will cause your player to strafe, and the camera angle 
will pitch up or down when you move the mouse forward or back). These 
changes should make those first two third-person camera modes more 
useful.

Firiona Vie server is available on Test now:

Or it will be very shortly...
You can get to this server by running testeverquest.exe from your 
EverQuest directory. Please read the Test Server disclaimer (available 
in the Test Server patch message) carefully before playing on the Test 
Server.

Here is part of the message from the Test Server.

*** Firiona Vie Server ***

The new Firiona Vie Server is now available for testing. As usual, 
please keep in mind that this is a Test server and we will be changing 
things as time goes by. The Test Server Disclaimer shown above applies 
to this server as well. Please be aware that when the server 'goes 
Live' all existing characters from the beta periods will be removed.

There are many special rules for this server. We will be keeping an 
updated list of these rules on our Developer's Corner message board. 
Please head over to www.everquest.com and head to the message boards 
for the most recent information about this server.

Here is the preliminary list of rules. To read this information later, 
you can refer to the testeqnews.txt file in your EverQuest folder.

* Firiona Vie Server Feature List *

This is a new server, not a split server. Nor will there be any 
transfers to this server.

Characters will be wiped before the server goes Live.

This is a PvE (Player vs. Environment) server, NOT a PvP (Player vs. 
Player) server. In other words, it's a standard 'blue' server with the 
same rules and features regarding PvP as the vast majority of our 
servers. It is not one of the 'Zeks'. 

Auction restricted to city zones: Qeynos, Surefall Glade, Highkeep, 
Freeport, Rivervale, Erudin, Halas, Neriak, Grobb, Oggok, Greater 
Faydark, Ak'Anon, Kaladim, Felwithe, Paineel, Cabilis, Kael and 
Thurgadin. 

Beneficial buff spells will not work on characters 20 levels lower than 
the caster. 

Each character will be assigned an "alignment" upon creation. This 
alignment will be described in brief on the character creation screen 
(in the same location the their Deity is described).

Each character will be able to change their alignment once any time 
after they reach 10th level if they choose. A character is not required 
to change alignments, but may do so any time after attaining 10th 
level. The player will be able to chose from a list of alignments based 
on their race, class and deity. 

A character's alignment will determine whether or not they can group or 
guild with other characters. (Note: The Guild portion of this code has 
not yet been implemented, and no guilds will be forming on this server 
until we can get it working).

A character's alignment will determine an experience bonus or penalty 
when grouping with other characters. 

A character's alignment will determine if they can cast beneficial 
spells on other characters (including resurrections). 

Language skills will improve only through group chat in the same zone 
and from /say. 

Languages will only improve 1 point each hour and will be capped at 
level*5+5 skill points. 

Common will not exist. A Human language will be added and only made 
easily available to certain races. 

One character per account. 

The Trivial Loot Code will be in effect in all zones. 

Very few items will be No-Drop. Exceptions will include things such as 
newbie notes and epic weapons.

Bind Affinity will be restricted for all characters to locations where 
melee characters can bind on other servers. 

/emote will be language specific 

All characters will be /roleplay. 

/alignment will display the alignment of your character and probably a 
more detailed description of that alignment. 

* Trivial Loot Code *

Briefly, the Trivial Loot Code works like this: If a character kills an 
NPC and that NPC does not give them experience, then the Trivial Loot 
Code takes effect. If any member of a group does not get experience for 
a kill, the Trivial Loot Code will take effect. The Trivial Loot Code 
prevents magical, lore and no-drop items from appearing on the corpse. 
Normal items and coins will appear on the corpse in all cases as usual.

October 5, 2001  Press Release - Graphics Upgrades
------------------------------

THE WORLD OF EVERQUEST® GOES HIGH RESOLUTION WITH EVERQUEST: THE 
SHADOWS OF LUCLIN™ EXPANSION

-Old World Environments To Rival Luclin's Beauty With Improved 
Graphics-

SAN DIEGO, CA - October 5, 2001- Sony Online Entertainment Inc., (SOE) 
announced today that EverQuest®: The Shadows of Luclin™ will launch 
with an additional CD-ROM featuring a complete upgrade to all textures 
throughout the original world of Norrath and all previous expansions.

"We are pleased to make this surprise announcement," said Brad McQuaid, 
Chief Creative Officer & Vice President, Sony Online Entertainment. 
"EverQuest players will be amazed at the clarity the texture upgrade 
provides and we feel the gameplay experience will be richly enhanced."

When EverQuest originally shipped in 1999, the development team 
utilized 32 x 32 low-resolution pixels because of graphics technology 
at the time. With the advent of superior graphic cards, the upgraded 
texture resolution featured in EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin will be 
256 x 256 pixels and occasionally as large as 512 x 512 pixels. This 
vast improvement in quality will make Norrath appear more vibrant and 
detailed than ever before.

"We have gone through the entire game and applied the new higher 
resolution textures by hand," said Scott McDaniel, EverQuest Art Lead, 
Sony Online Entertainment. "The sheer size of EverQuest has made this 
upgrade quite a project. To see the old zones in high resolution is 
really exciting for the entire team."

EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin features over 24 new zones, rideable 
mounts, all new character models, new facial animations, and over 120 
new spells and will be available on retail shelves in December 2001. 
For more information visit the official Shadows of Luclin website at . 

The Station (www.station.com) is the official provider of EverQuest, 
with software updates and news about the game, message boards and other 
community features, as well as an easy-to-use billing system for 
EverQuest's monthly subscription fee.

October 8, 2001
------------------------------

*** Item Changes ***

- Increased the duration on Song of the Deep Seas (the proc on a bardic 
weapon) dramatically.

- Modified the effect of Feast of Blood (weapon proc) it is now a DoT 
lifetap

- Added a texture to Flayed Barbarian Skin Leggings.

- Added Illusion: Barbarian to the Flayed Barbarian Hide Mask.


*** Miscellaneous Changes ***

- The last language used by your character will be stored in your 
eqclient.ini file when you log out. This means that if the last 
character you were playing was speaking Elvish, then when you log back 
in with any character, that character will be speaking Elvish if he 
can, otherwise it will be set to a default language (most often 
Common).

*** Magic System Changes ***

There is a more detailed explanation of these changes posted on our 
Developer's Corner. Please visit there for more details (either at 
www.everquest.com or http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-
bin/Ultimate.cgi). Here is a summary of the changes:

- The level-based spell resistance bonus inherent in super-high level 
NPCs has been reduced significantly.

- Several NPCs have had their resistances reduced. Each of them was 
examined carefully, and resistances changed as seemed appropriate. For 
some of these NPCs other things were changed as well to compensate for 
their increased susceptibility to spells, such as armor improvements or 
perhaps greater hit points, if needed for that NPC.

- NPCs that were highly magic resistant in order to make them immune to 
certain spells can now be given specific immunity to those spells. This 
means that they can be made immune to critical spells, as intended, and 
still be generally less resistant to magic. Players will receive a 
message similar to the one that is already given for Mesmerization 
spells when they cast a spell on an NPC that it is specifically immune 
to.

IMPORTANT NOTE: It is very important to note that we have not made any 
NPCs immune to spells that they were not already immune to. Many NPCs 
that were previously immune to spells due to their high innate 
resistance to magic have had that resistance reduced and specific 
immunities added. So if you see an immunity message after attempting to 
cast a spell on an NPC that you hadn't seen such a message from before, 
understand that the NPC was already immune to that spell before due to 
high resistances, and the only difference is that it now has lower 
resistances in general and specific spell immunity (which is why you 
are seeing the message).

*** Melee Changes ***

After extensive research, testing, and evaluation we have completed the 
melee portion of our class balancing. To be clear, these changes apply 
just to the combat aspect of melee classes. Any issues with non-combat 
skills, spell effects, spell selection, or non-combat aspects of 
classes will be evaluated in the near future. With the completion of 
the melee combat balancing, we will be moving onto spells and spell 
casting classes. 

Due to the extensive nature of these changes, we can't describe them in 
detail here. A detailed summary will be available on our Developer's 
Corner message board. Please visit www.everquest.com and our forums for 
more information.

* Summary of Melee Changes *

- Two-Handed Weapons have been given an increased damage bonus for 
characters over level 50. Also, certain post-epic quality two-handers 
have been improved.

- Warriors have had their taunt skill cap increased to 230 at 60th 
level. Also, the Blades of Strategy and Tactics can now be used in 
either hand.

- Rogues, as the primary user of piercing weapons, will benefit from an 
improvement in the quality of a few existing high-end daggers. At some 
future date new piercing weapons will be added to the game to fill gaps 
in equipment availability.

- Monks will now be on an improved combat table at levels 55 and again 
to a better table at 60. Monks now have the ability to Triple Attack at 
60th level. The minimum damage done by Flying Kick will be greatly 
increased for monks starting at 51st level and scaling up to level 60. 
We also intend to add more monk weapons in the future to fill equipment 
gaps.

- Rangers have their Double Attack skill cap raised to 245. They have 
also gained an innate offensive bonus that starts at level 55 and 
increases until level 60. Ranger's Defense skill cap has been raised to 
220, and their Riposte skill cap has been raised to 185.

- Paladins and Shadowknights, besides the benefits they gain from the 
two-handed weapons change mentioned above, have also been moved to the 
same combat tables as warriors. In the future we intend to examine the 
existing one-handed weapons useable by knights for possible upgrades. 
We are also increasing the Taunt skill cap for these two classes to 
220.

- Bards have had their 1h blunt and 1h slash skill caps increased to 
250. Their piercing skill cap has been increased to 240. Their Offense 
skill cap has been raised to 252. Bards are also being moved to the 
same combat table with all the other melee and hybrid classes (save 
monks who have separate tables after level 55). Bards Parry skill cap 
has been raised to 185 as well. Finally, the Singing Shortsword can now 
be equipped in the off hand and still give full song enhancing 
benefits.

Please read the detailed explanation of these changes on our 
Developer's Corner message boards at 
http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi

*** Firiona Vie (Roleplaying Preferred) server goes Live ***

Our newest special rules server is now available. Firiona Vie is 
designated as roleplaying preferred. There are many special rules for 
this server, please read over them carefully before playing. We will be 
keeping an updated list of these rules on our web site at 
http://everquest.station.sony.com/guidebook/firionavie.jsp .

latest gossip, and community news for their hometowns.

** A Tale from Norrath **

Adventurers, glory seekers, and plunder-hungry knaves,

A few new tavern tales have been circulating from across the Deep. It 
appears that strife and civil unrest have once again plagued the lands 
of Kunark. Stories of treachery and terror within the ranks of the 
Sarnak have spilled forth from the mountain fortress of Chardok.

Only a few of the most cunning spies have made their way into the 
Sarnak hive during this brief time of turmoil, and their reports may 
have serious implications. The Brood of Di`zok seems to be more 
organized than before. Their leadership is becoming more structured... 
and much more brutal. Production in the mines appears to be increasing 
and soldiers have been amassing in great numbers.

Other tales have come from this mountain fortress as well. Terror 
squads and interrogators have decimated the ranks of reported Sarnak 
traitors. These squads have been working under the leadership of one of 
the Sarnak Collective's newest council members, Korucust. It can only 
be presumed that this cleansing is another step towards strengthening 
the foul brood.

These tales are hard to confirm, since many of your adventurous kind 
are prone to drink and to the occasional mistruth. If these tales are 
true, it would only stand to reason that new dangers may reveal new 
wealth and glory. Perhaps it is time for you to gather your best gear, 
finish your mug of ale, and head out to investigate.

Good luck adventurers.

** Project M Implemented **

Tonight we have patched something to the PvP servers that many players 
have been waiting for. The ability to play that gnoll, orc, or the cute 
and fuzzy rat. On your character select screen you will notice another 
button in the upper right part of your screen called "Monster". 
Clicking this button will randomly place you in a low-level NPC in a 
random zone. You will be given full control of the creature to do with 
it what you like. You may hunt and kill other creatures. You may even 
attack other players.

Some things to remember when playing your own personal monster (NPC).

-You will not be able to interact with players or NPC's other than 
moving and hitting attack.
-You cannot speak, trade, sell, or do anything else that a player can 
do.
-You will spawn with normal loot for the monster you are playing and 
Player Characters will be able to kill you for loot and experience.
-If you are a spell casting monster you might want to take a moment to 
memorize some spells.
-Once you die, you will return to the character select screen where you 
may choose to return as another NPC or play your normal character.
-You may gain experience, levels, and skills as this NPC, but once you 
die, it is all lost. You will need to start over the next time you 
choose to be a NPC character.
-You can't zone as a monster.
-Monster PCs (MPCs) can not loot, sell, or gain items. They only get 
what they start out with.

This ability to play a monster is being implemented for PvP servers 
only as we have no plans to implement non-consensual PvP on a non PvP 
server.

However, we are still working with this system. We may find other ways 
to implement Project M on the non-PvP servers that are acceptable. We 
aren't done looking at the possible uses of this new feature.

** PvP Server Related **

- Guards, when seeing PCs in combat, will now attack the one that they 
like the least (the one with the lowest appropriate faction). If all 
the PCs involved are highly regarded (have very high faction) the 
guards will allow them to resolve their own issues without interfering.

- Guards should also refrain from attacking PCs that are attacked by 
pets of any sort.

- Sullon Zek now has an across the board experience bonus of 20%, and 
the experience loss on all deaths on Sullon Zek is now 50% less.

** Zone Specific Changes **

- Kael now has specific bind locations, located only at the entryways. 
This means that binding will only be possible in those areas.

- Anti-bottom feeding code has been removed from the Stonebrunt 
Mountains and the Warrens.

- Added a melee bind location to the dock in Iceclad.

** Bug Fixes **

- Fixed a bug that allowed corpses to exist inside walls. Now if a 
corpse ends up in a location that is not 'valid' the corpse will be 
moved to the 'safe coordinates' of the zone. Also, the /corpse command 
will now summon your own corpse to you anywhere in the zone as long as 
that corpse is on the safe spot of the zone. This should prevent 
corpses from being stuck in walls.

- Fixed it so that Critical Hit damage messages match the actual damage done.

- The visible damage bonus modifier on two-handed weapons has been 
corrected. The value that was displayed was incorrect, no change has 
been made to the damage bonus itself.

** Item Changes **

- Fixed an issue with the Bardic Epic weapon. Now if the bard has his 
Epic and an instrument that gives bonuses to songs, the best effect 
will take precedence, rather than the Epic bonuses always being used.

- Cloak of Imperception should now have charges. You will need to 
exchange your old one for a new one with your GM within the next five 
days.

- Donal's Chestplate of Mourning has unlimited charges again.

** Gameplay/Interface Changes/Additions **

- We have changed the way the /consider command works. We have added a 
'light blue' area between green and blue. NPCs that used to /consider 
green but gave experience will now /consider light blue, as well as 
NPCs of slightly lower level than those greens. You will always get 
experience for something that is light blue. You will not receive 
experience for greens. At the same time, by including lower level NPCs 
in the light blue /consider, we have increased the range of lower level 
NPCs that will grant experience. This will be most noticeable for 
characters of higher level.

- Added /targetgroupbuff. Type /targetgroupbuff on to activate, off to 
turn it off. When on, all group buff spells you cast will require a 
target but will affect everyone grouped (and in range) with that 
target, even if it is not your own group. When it is off your group 
buff spells will act normally. This will only work with group buffs 
that have a duration, and will not affect heals, portals or change form 
spells.

- Added code that will put one item onto your cursor if it won't fit 
into your inventory due to a cancelled trade or looting items (and 
other cases). This will only work if there is not already an item on 
the cursor.

- Added code that prevents player characters from dropping coins on the 
ground. This should prevent the loss of coins due to accident or scam.

- Made a modification to the chase camera mouselook code. Moving the 
mouse forward or back in this camera view will make the camera move up 
and down, and the camera also automatically pitches to keep your 
character in view.

- You now see the number of hit points you are healed, and you also now 
see how many hit points you heal when healing others.

** Skill Changes **

- Bard Piercing cap was raised to 250 at 60th level.

- Foraging and Fishing will now result in a wider variety of items, 
especially in zones that have unusual items available to forage or fish 
(such as quest items). Quest and unique items were too common in zones 
that had them, often making it hard to use those skills to obtain items 
such as food and drink. These quest and rare items will now actually be 
rarely foraged or fished, as they should have been. Such items will 
still be available, even to those with low foraging skills, but they 
will be more easily found by those who have practiced the skills.

** Follow-up Patch **

We had a couple of bugs pop up in yesterday's patch. Rather than having 
everyone wait to see them fixed we've elected to roll them in now:

Bards lost the ability to use item effects while moving. This has been 
fixed.

Monks can now train mend again.

Fixed a collision problem that caused people to fall through some 
walls.

Fixed a problem with /targetgroupbuff that allowed people to cast 
combat portal spells on others. 

We apologize for the inconvenience.

** Server Outage for Shadows of Luclin Launch **

In order to update our server for the launch of EverQuest: Shadows of 
Luclin, all servers will be taken down starting at noon on Monday, 
December 3rd. They will be brought back up again on Tuesday, December 
4th at 8 am (Pacific Time - which is -8:00 GMT).

We regret the down time that setting up the new expansion requires. 
Shadows of Luclin offers some exciting new content as well as a 
fantastic new graphics engine. We hope that you'll agree with us that 
Shadows of Luclin is well worth the extended patch time.

Thanks for your patience.

** DirectX 8.0 or higher Required for EverQuest **

When we update the servers on December 3rd for Shadows of Luclin, we 
will also be updating a lot of the code for the existing game. This 
code is written specifically for use with DirectX 8.0 and higher, and 
should provide better performance to most of our customers. The 
improvement will be most noticeable for people using newer hardware.

This will require that all EverQuest players update their DirectX to 
version 8.0 or better to play EverQuest. We will be providing an 
instructional page to help people with this upgrade in the very near 
future at www.everquestlive.com. If you want to test your DirectX 8 
configuration and drivers sooner rather than later, you can do so by 
running "TestEverQuest.exe" in your EverQuest directory and logging on 
to the Test Server. Please view the patch message there for information 
should you have any problems logging in.

*EQClient INI Setting*

There's some confusion about the information that's been released on 
the Test server over the past couple of days, and that confusion is 
resulting in some people having trouble playing EverQuest. To clear it 
up:

The GraphicsDLL setting in your EQClient.ini file should read 
"GraphicsDLL=EQGfx_Dx7.dll" regardless of what server you are playing 
on or what version of DirectX you are running. If you are having 
problems getting in to EverQuest, specifically, problems crashing prior 
to reaching character select, please check and set this entry in your 
EQClient.ini as necessary.

Also, as a reminder, all EverQuest subscribers will need to have 
DirectX 8.1 or better installed on their system in order to play 
beginning Tuesday morning. The latest version of DirectX can be found 
at http://www.microsoft.com/directx.

*** Welcome to Luclin *** 

"As you know, youngster, we of the League of Antonican Bards have made 
it our primary goal to travel to places before others. It is our duty 
to see what hasn't yet been seen and to make song of it when we return. 
We carry news, song and spirit to all of Norrath. We have also taken it 
upon ourselves to carry personal news in the form of letters wherever 
possible. And that's what I've called you here to talk about. 

... 

No, I am not assigning you the duty of establishing a mail route into 
Grobb. We've lost far too many young bards trying to do that. 
Recruitment of smart young lads and lasses is nearly impossible when 
they all think that we plan to send them out to become bard fillet. 
We've only been able to recruit youngsters that no other guild wanted 
because they were so... 

... 

No, of course I don't mean you. 

Now stop interrupting. 

I have a job for you. You know, don't you, that Al'Kabor has once again 
been clomping about using his powerful magics without much regard for 
consequences, don't you? 

... 

/em sighs. 

Ok, your FIRST task is to read up on current events! () 

Your second task is to find out if the rumors about his recent 
experiments are true. They say (and "they" are pretty reliable) that 
things such as noble-looking Kerrans calling themselves the Vah Shir, 
strange beasts of burden and new spells and songs have started showing 
up on Antonica. They also say that this is all due to the experiments 
of that Erudite Wizard Al'Kabor. You are to head out to one of the 
great wizard spires and investigate. If you can, interview one of these 
cat people and bring us back one of these horses they talk about... 

... 

Maybe you should talk to my assistant about things like directions out 
of the city and where you can find some shoes more appropriate for 
travel." 

All this you overhear as you wait outside for your turn to talk to the 
loremasters of the League of Antonican Bards. 

The door opens and you see a dejected and confused looking young bard 
step out. Following him out the door you hear a bellow, 

"I also expect you to let everyone know that we are NO LONGER trying to 
establish mail routes to Grobb! Trolls can't read very well anyway." 

Shadows of Luclin opens up new adventures and new challenges, as well 
as new rewards for those with a spirit of adventure. 

Are you up to the challenge? 

*** Notes for Shadows of Luclin customers *** 

IMPORTANT: do not lose your Shadows of Luclin CDs. Because of the 
immense amount of data on the three Shadows of Luclin CDs, you will not 
be able to just copy the executable file into a new directory and 
download the rest of the expansion. We have placed restrictions on the 
amount of data that customers can download from our patcher so that 
massive patching as a replacement for reinstalling from the disk will 
not impact our other customers. So if you have a hard drive problem or 
you wish to install EverQuest on a new computer, you will need to have 
your CD to do so. 

TECH SUPPORT: Please visit our Tech Support Center at if you have any 
problems with your Luclin installation. 

/facepick - this new command will allow those of you with Shadows of 
Luclin to change your characters face. It will only work for characters 
using the new models. If you've turned off Gnomes and your character is 
a Gnome, you will not be able to use this command on that character. 
And it will, obviously, only work for those with Shadows of Luclin 
installed. 

/dismount - This command allows your character to dismount from a horse 
if for some reason he has lost the ability to do so using the bridle. 
There is no /mount command, only the bridle will allow you to mount a 
horse. 

*** Other Changes with this Patch *** 

Along with our preparations for the introduction of Shadows of Luclin, 
we have made a few other changes with this patch: 

** Gameplay Changes ** 

- Increased the amount of mana given by high Intelligence and Wisdom 
scores, as well as that granted by items and spells. 

- Fixed a bug that was causing rogues to critical with every use of a 
thrown weapon. 

- Fixed a bug that caused the experience bar to displaying incorrectly 
after leveling. This also seemed to cause a crash in certain cases when 
in F10 view. 

** PvP Changes ** 

- PVP looting will now display to the group. 

- Empty corpses will no longer disappear when looted by an enemy 
player, they will decay at the normal rate for empty corpses. 

- Guards in 'guard zones', such as cities, will continue to protect 
characters that they find the least offensive (the one with the highest 
faction). But guards in outdoor zones will be less likely to join in a 
fight. They will only come to the aid of people that they like. 
Otherwise they will not get involved in PvP combat. 

- Etched Peridot of Nature will be removed from all locations, 
including those held by players on their characters or in their banks. 
This item was not intended to be available until Shadows of Luclin went 
live, and then only in Luclin zones. 

** Spell Changes ** 

- Spells that heal less than 10 points of damage will not generate a 
message to the player. 

- Velious portal teeth (Great Divide, Wakening Lands and Cobalt Scar) 
are no longer required to teleport to those locations. These items are 
also no longer soul bound. 

- Fixed a bug with the Bard Song of Occlusion 

** New Commands ** 

- /stand now implemented. We've added this command because not everyone 
speaks programmer and would think that the logical reverse of /sit 
would be /sit off. :) 

- /particledensity command - Switches particle density on the fly 
without having to click it in the menus and exit the game. 

** Some new things you'll see ** 

- We now have the ability to flag an NPC as non-targetable. This in 
effect renders the NPC non-attackable as well. Clicking on one of these 
NPCs will cause your current target selection to clear. This 
functionality is used primarily for the presentation of content. For 
instance, if we want an NPC to spawn and tell you a story, he can tell 
his story without being attacked mid-sentance by other players. It also 
opens up some pretty interesting content avenues. As an example, we can 
make NPCs unharmable until you do a quest "stripping them of their 
power". 

- There are several new item classes (types) in the world. For example, 
there are weapons that do enhanced damage versus certain races (e.g. 
Perhaps you'll find a +2 vs froglok sword, or a +4 vs Bear club. In 
addition we can do the same type of thing with types of creatures (+3 
vs humanoid, +1 vs Undaed). We've also added elemental modifiers (e.g. 
a +4 Fire sword). The bonus value is calculated as and increased DMG 
stat on the weapon, except that the elemental portion is run through 
the resistance system before calculating the strength of your hit. 
There are some items out there with bonuses to some more interesting 
stats, but we'll leave it to you to figure them out :) 

- There's a lot more out there. Be prepared to reevaluate your 
assumptions and redefine the way you approach the world. Proposed 
solutions to situations and quests that you might have previously 
written off saying, "They can't do that in EverQuest", might be exactly 
the way you need to approach the problem at hand. As fellow gamers, we 
envy you as you approach Luclin and find everything fresh, new, and 
waiting to be solved. And to those of you who aren't first to solve the 
quests or adventure in the new areas, we urge you to do so with your 
friends, and leave the spoiler sites out of it. Good luck on your 
journies. 

** Note on New Features ** 

EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin contains many new features which have 
yet to stand up to the scrutiny of 400,000 experienced players. Without 
doubt there will be some situations where we need to reevaluate the 
gameplay-impact of some of those features and adjust them accordingly 
to maintain game integrity. As an example, we think that they might 
accelerate and decelerate too quickly, but will have to wait until we 
see them used by a broad spectrum of players before we can make a final 
determination. We thank you for your patience in these matters. 

** Note on Impending Features **

As we approached our launch date we found that several features which 
are planned are also not yet ready for prime-time. We're currently 
working on the following items, many of which will be implemented in 
the very near future: 

- Extra flora in outdoor zones. Sprigs of grass, small bushes, flowers, 
etc. 

- A robuste merchantile system in the bazaar that lets you flag 
yourself as a merchant, set prices, and conduct business without having 
to conduct business manually with each buyer and seller. 

- We will be polishing up issues regarding tinted items in game. In 
other words, things that shouldn't tint with a tinted item (e.g. your 
skin) won't tint when the feature is complete. 

- Light beards on high elves, dark elves, half elves, and dwarf females 
will be tintable along with the hair color. We are going to leave in 
the ability for you to change your appearance until after we've added 
more customization options. 

We thank you for your patience and patronage as we implement these 
features. Good luck with your adventures on Luclin!

*Fixed Bugs*

- Fixed a bug that was preventing characters from being bald (those 
that were allowed to).
- Halved the speed of the new Skeleton walk and run animations because 
they were playing about twice as fast as they should have been.
- Fixed a bug that was causing all of the facial features (hair, beard, 
etc...) to switch back to default in certain cases when you switched 
from one face to another (faces with special eyes, like the faces with 
eye patches and white eye).
- Fixed a crash bug with /follow. 
- Found and Fixed the crash bug with soldungb and everfrost and other 
places.
- Fixed transparency code with i810 display adapters
- Fixed a problem introduced into the sound engine that causes 
framerate problems and sound stutter in some places.
- Fixed a crash bug that had to do with dying from your familiar 
effect.
- Research the group buff bug and fixed it.
- Fixed a crash bug with root and gate.
- Various item and content fixes.

*Hot Items* (The items we're considering top priority)

- Bard issues: We're working to correct the problems bards have been 
experiencing with their songs.
- K6 Processors: We're working to fix, or provide a work-around for 
problems AMD K6 users are experiencing when entering some zones. 
- Armor layer tinting (e.g. tinting your armor without tinting your 
skin)

We are reviewing the issues sent to us as they are sent in and will be 
doing daily patches as necessary to get everything working to your and 
our satisfaction as quickly as possible. Please remember that EverQuest 
users need to have DirectX 8.1 and the appropriate drivers for their 
video card. Visit our tech support center first if you are having 
issues:

*Fixes*

- Shaved 10 seconds of zoning for every subscriber.
- Made it so familiars don't get agroed on.
- Fixed several zone crash bugs
- Changed a paladin spell - a design error in the spell trivialized 
several aspects of the high-end game.
- Fixed several item and content problems.
- Fixed several faction issues - some faction information released with 
Luclin deviated from norm.

December 10, 2001  3:00 am

*Patch Changes*

- Fixed a problem that resulted in excessive swapping for people with 
particles turned off.

- Fear spells should again be working correctly.

- AoE fear spells will no longer work versus players on PvP Servers.

- Fixed a crash caused by a familiar dying.

- Fixed a bug with the "Alternate Advancement" system. An artifact from 
the removal of the class-based experience penalty several months ago 
resulted in hybrids gaining AAXP much faster than they should, and 
warriors and rogues gaining it slower. AA-point cost was designed to be 
the same regardless of class.

- Increased the experience cost per AA-point overall after analysis of 
point accruals accross the game. 

- Corrected several zone-crashes. Also implemented a workaround to 
prevent the Hollowshade crash while we investigate the problem further.

- Fixed several miscellaneous bugs that were causing crashes or had the 
potential to cause crashes on varied systems. 

- Fixed a bug that caused some people to crash when reentering the game 
after exiting.

- Addressed a good number of content-related issues (quest problems, 
bad items, etc).

*Luclin Install*

- We found that the default install directory for Luclin may be wrong 
for some people, specifically those who have copied their EverQuest 
files into a directory different from their initial installation. 

- Also, we've received a number of calls from Luclin subscribers who've 
tried logging in to their character on a friends computer that does not 
have an install of Luclin on it. This will not work as the files 
necessary for you to view Luclin content are not present unless Luclin 
has been installed. 

- We've added code to point out both of these cases in the future.

*Continued Plans*

- As we wrap up the technology-related issues over the course of this 
week, making sure that everyone who wants to play EverQuest can play 
EverQuest, the programming team will shift their focus to aesthetic 
issues such as animation speed/timing, armor tinting, face-picker 
operation, etc. We do indeed plan on getting to all of these issues in 
the very short term.

- The content-team, however, is hard at work on content-related issues 
right now, and stands ready to address any broken quests, items, 
encounter-imbalances, etc., that you may run across in your adventures. 
Please feel free to visit our forums off of www.everquestlive.com and 
submit a comment through the Developer's Corner.

Thank you for your patronage,

*Patch Changes*

- Fixed a memory leak that was causing excessive swapping when moving 
between outdoor Luclin zones.
- Implemented some changes to zoning that should improve times, 
especially for modem users.
- Fixed several potential crash bugs.
- You can now only have 100 unused points in your alternate advancement 
pool.
- Fixed the bug that prevented non-Luclin subscribers from seeing the 
Vah Shir model.
- Addressed many content-related problems. We appreciate the reports 
we've received. 
- Continued optimizations of the 3D engine.

* Patch Changes *

- Several changes to hair functionality: Expanded beard color choices 
for Erudite males, pushed back the camera a bit for human males when 
making hair selections (so they can see themselves) and fixed it so 
that the camera will no longer rotate around Erudites while in hair 
selection mode of character creation. Also fixed a bug with the left 
selection arrow sometimes not changing hair color.
- Fixed the "Entering Luclin" message bug. This was only an errant text 
message, it was not causing any crashes or keeping anyone out of the 
game.
- Fixed a bug where Vah Shir with an intelligence over a certain amount 
could not be created.
- Fixed a bug with faction-affecting items: They were giving a bonus to 
all factions instead of just the intended faction
- Fixed a problem with arrows and quivers that would result in the 
person being logged out.
- Adjusted the cost of Combine Platemail to be inline with its stats 
and other armor available within game.
- Made several gameplay changes to The Grey. A single group having the 
ability to simultaneously engage and prevail against 35+ experience-
giving creatures is not in line with the desire for risk vs. reward and 
the promotion of balanced groups.
- Removed some bad NPCs in Chardok.
- Tuned encounters in The Fungus Grove, Maiden's Eye, and Dawnshroud 
Peaks.
- Clarified some quest dialog in Sanctus Seru.
- Tuned The Deep, also improved the variety of drops.
- Improved pathing in The Temple of Ssraeshza
- Improved pathing in Sanctus Seru
- Improved pathing in Echo Caverns
- Added some newbie beastlord quests in the old world.
- Removed the "Lore" tag from the "Darkened Knight's Bracer"

** Texture Cache **

In an effort to improve loading and zoning times, we've added the 
ability to cache textures to your hard drive. One of the things that 
your computer is doing when you load up the game or change zones is 
building textures and putting them into RAM on your computer. Each time 
you log in or zone the game has to create the textures you need and put 
them into RAM for use during gameplay.

This, obviously, takes a little time.

We have added an option that allows you to save that information to 
your hard drive rather than creating it each time you log in or zone.

This does have a few drawbacks. It will require a lot of hard drive 
space to store these textures. In the most extreme case it could use up 
as much as 1.5 GB of hard drive space, though this would be the 
extreme. It could, however, easily use 500 MB of space on your hard 
drive. And because writing all this data to your hard drive takes a 
little time, the first time you use this feature it will take a bit 
longer to log in.

The game will never allow you to fall below 500 MB of space on your 
hard drive when creating the texture cache. This is to prevent any 
problems with a shortage of space on your hard drive. But it also means 
that you will need to have plenty of hard drive space free to use this 
option; 500 MB plus the amount needed for the texture cache.

Also, if you change any of your setting for graphics {like changing the 
texture quality) it will have to rewrite these files, meaning that your 
first log in after making such a change will take longer than usual as 
it writes these files to your hard drive.

The benefits is that once you have allocated the hard drive space and 
logged in to create the needed files, the game can then read that 
information directly into RAM from your hard drive rather than creating 
them each time you log in or zone.

What this feature does not allow you to do is to increase the settings 
above those that are recommended. If the game suggests that you only 
use ten models, turning on the Texture Cache will not make it a good 
idea to turn on more models. This feature will not change that. Those 
recommendations are based on the amount of RAM you have available and 
your video card. The hard drive cache does not effectively add RAM to 
your machine, it just allows the game to save time creating the 
textures that your existing RAM and video card use.

There are two ways to activate this feature. You can check the 'Texture 
Cache' box in the Options screen, or you can turn it on from within the 
eqclient.ini file. To activate it, add the following line to the 
eqclient.ini file:

TextureCache=TRUE

This could improve load times dramatically depending on your settings. 
The more models and graphics features you have turned on, the greater 
the potential decrease in loading times you will see using the Texture 
Cache.

Remember: This will require a lot of hard drive space, so be certain 
that you have a lot of free hard drive space if you turn this option 
on. The more stuff you enable (models, texture quality, etc.) the more 
space you will need.

We expect this to be of greatest benefit to folks with 256 megs of RAM 
and a lot of hard drive space. The more RAM your system has, the less 
benefit you should expect to see by using the texture cache.

* Patch Changes *

- Fixed a pathing problem in the waters of Acrylia Caverns
- More fixes for face and hair issues: Most notably a bug with Erudite 
male hair color arrows changing the hair style instead of the color.
- Fixed a problem that was causing the % to crash some people when 
using in tells.
- Addressed several potential crash bugs.

.....................................................................

December 14, 2001  3:00 am
------------------------------

- Removing or killing your familiar will no longer have the possibility 
of killing you directly. It can, however, take you down to very few hit 
points...
- Skyshrine key is soulbound once again
- Custom Velious helms should now be visible
- Plate helmets should now be visible on Vah Shir
- Female humans should no longer see the inside of their heads when 
firing a bow
- Using the ESC key to exit the /facepick menu should no longer lock 
the right mouse button
- Fixed an issue with several transparencies, including Vox and Nagafen 
spots, Kael giants helms, halfling helm and old dark elf model hair
- The Kneel and Grovel emotes are no longer switched
- The BACK and NEXT buttons on the last page of the keyboard options 
now work properly.
- The 'ALT' pop-up for spells memorized will no longer show up if the 
memorized spells window is not open
- Removed the mipmap setting from in-game Options-->Display menu. The 
mipmap setting found at the options menu before log in is now the valid 
way to change mipmapping settings
- Improved the pathing in Echo Caverns
- Staff of Living Sand and Skull-Shaped Sacrificial Hammer should no 
longer say that they are out of charges.
- The Ruthless Bracer is now a wrist item, not a shoulder item

** Note about upcoming changes to the Temple of Veeshan **

In the next patch, we are making a few changes to the monster 
population in Temple of Veeshan. Places that were previously safe to 
camp, may not be any longer. Please be sure to not camp deep within the 
Temple of Veeshan on Wednesday night, or you may be unpleasantly 
surprised following the patch.

* Bug Fixes *

- Fixed a bug with sleeves not showing properly when wearing robes

* Item Changes * 

- Aqualung charges should now work properly

* Trade Skill Changes *

- Regular, medium quality, high quality, mithril, brellium and 
adamantite rings, as well as their enchanted versions are now 
stackable.
- Added a few trade skill vendors to Ak'Anon
- Added ore, clay, pottery sketch, baking, and brewing vendors to 
Felwithe to round out the tradeskill supplies available in Felwithe and 
Kelethin.
- Crafted fishing flies, special fishing poles and special baits now 
add a fishing skill bonus.
- Made all Bait and flies equipable in the Ammo slot.
- Added clay, ore and brewing supply vendors to Halas.
- Added several trade skill vendors to Oggok.

* Localization Information *

Localization on the EverQuest login/chat server has been fixed so that 
users can once again select French and German. Japanese and Korean have 
also been added.

To obtain the text files which enable a language, go to the Advanced 
Options screen in the patcher and click on the appropriate language box 
before clicking on "Download".

* Soulbinders *

A new group has appeared in Norrath (and on Luclin as well). Rumor has 
it that these 'Soulbinders' have dedicated themselves to research on 
the power and essence of our inner being. Some call them fanatics, as 
they claim that knowledge of the spirit that dwells within will lead 
them to an understanding of the whole of existence. Citizens often 
treat them with the same respect and distance that they treat the 
Priests of Discord. However, these Soulbinders have dedicated 
themselves to public service, and for them that service falls along 
their lines of specialty...

The next time you find yourself far away from home, you might seek the 
services of a Soulbinder.

/ooc: We've added these "Soulbinder" NPCs to all cities that player 
characters can start in, as well as Firiona Vie, The Overthere, 
Shadowhaven and Iceclad at the request of players. It is our hope that 
these new NPCs will help players by reducing the time it takes to find 
a bind from another player character.

** Items **

- All beastlord-usable items are now useable by their requisite races
- Regular, medium quality, high quality, mithril, brellium and 
adamantite rings, as well as their enchanted versions are now 
stackable. (this time we mean it)
- Made Rune Encrusted Short Sword rentable (was No Rent, should not 
have been)
- Fixed Shadowscream and all related recipes so that they return the 
correct mallet
- Reduced the price of the Fuligan Soulstone of Innoruuk and Cloudy 
Stone of Veeshan
- Reduced the price of the first two keys for the Plane of Air

charges as originally intended
- Gauntlets of the Blood Fiend - Warrior has been removed from the 
wearable classes
- Shiny Trinket of Speed - An appropriate level of haste has been added 
to this item

** Interface **

- Added /tgb as a short version of /targetgroupbuff

- /shownames now works with the following parameters:
no parameter = display the current setting.
off = don't show player names over their heads
1 = show only first names of players
2 = show First and Last Name
3 = show First, Last, and Guild (if any)
4 = show Title (if any), First, Last, and Guild (if any)

Also, the LFG, AFK and LD tags will always show if names are not off. 
There will no longer be brackets around them, and LFG will now appear 
at the end of the name with the AFK and LD tags (instead of being a * 
at the beginning)

- A player character will always have a name over its head, even if 
they are skeletons (unless /shownames is off), with the exception of 
some rare cases when players are turned into certain NPCs 
- Added /ttell. This will send a tell to the player character that is 
currently your target. The command will also allow corpses as a valid 
target. /ttell'ing a player's corpse will auto-tell that player (this 
was actually patched earlier along with an emergency patch)
- Added IRC style '/me' as a synonym for /emote (this was actually 
patched earlier along with an emergency patch)
- Added '/send' as a synonym for /tell (this was actually patched 
earlier along with an emergency patch)

** Spells **

- Necromancer Group spells should now be working, they were only 
affecting the caster. This includes spells such as: Degeneration, 
Succession of Shadows, Crippling Claudication, and Zavfeer's Theft of

will be fixed soon.

duration increased as well

Hero in Ssra Temple

stun spells (this was actually patched earlier along with an emergency 
patch)

- Changed the automatic targeting code so that it won't automatically 
target someone that cast a beneficial spell on you

** Patch Update **

Today we are sending you a couple of new DLL files that should do the 
following:

- May improve performance in indoor Luclin zones

- Should improve zoning time in many cases, especially in zones with 
many objects/trees. May also reduce the "hitch" when other players zone 
in, though it probably won't remove it completely

- May reduce the cases where some players experience a performance 
reduction after being in a zone for a while

- Fixed a bug that was causing some portions of spell effects and the 
"bolts" in bolts spells to not show up.

- Generally improve stability.

How these changes affect individuals will vary, but we hope that this 
will improve game performance a bit over all.

- Ragefire portion of the Cleric Epic quest has been changed. Please 
see the Developer's Corner on our web site for more details
- Added Quest NPCs to Thurgadin, Kael and Skyshrine for Beastlord quest 
armor
- Gravel leaf tea will now fit in the combine container for the 
associated quest
- Grimling Blood should now be dropping
- Idia in the bard guild in Kelethin was telling you to turn in a quest 
item to the incorrect NPC. Changed quest text to reflect the correct 
NPC to hand the item to
- In Iceclad, Keref Spiritspear won't be so unreasonable when you 
complete the task that he asks of you
- Citizens in skyshrine no longer defend the 'vermin' spiders
- Increased the drop rate of the Staff of Elemental Mastery: Earth
- Bloody Shak Dratha Hearts should now be dropping
- Quest of Nobility should now be working properly
- Increased the spawn rate of Brother Qwinn tenfold


** Items **

- Adjusted statistics on equipment that was dropping in the Umbral 
Plains. Many of the items had AC that was inconsistent with the armor 
types of the classes. The AC has been reduced on some pieces and raised 
on others. In all instances where the AC was dropped a different 
statistic was raised. Several items received a significant upgrade 
while others were downgraded
- Also in regards to Umbral Plains armor, Ranger has been removed from 
the plate class armor that was dropping and have been added to the 
usable classes on the chain equivalent. Bards have been added to the 
plate equipment list. This might mean that some Rangers will have armor 
that they can't use. Our Customer Service personnel will trade out that 
armor for the chain equivalent
- Ghoulbane is now No-Drop
- SoulFire charges can only be used by Paladins (though they can be 
used from inventory)
- Raised the armor value on many Beastlord specific armor pieces
- Added effects to a few of the Wild Lord's armor pieces
- Added Vah Shir to Imbrued Plate Mail useable races
- Rhino Hide armor is now Druid and Monk usable
- The Crustacean Shell Shield is now magic
- Scroll of Knowledge can now be equipped in the primary, secondary, 
and range slots
- Scroll of Enlightenment can now be equipped in the primary, 
secondary, and range slots
- Thought Horror Fangs can now be thrown
- Iron Scroll of War must now be worn to activate
- Cloak of Thorns right click effect should work now

"range" value has been removed to prevent people from accidentally 
throwing them

- Greaves of Avoidance can now be used by all races
- Steel Threaded Wrist Wraps are no longer lore
- Bravado's Breastplate now grants a larger Hit Point bonus
- Guise of the Hunter can now also be worn by human bards and rogues 
- Primal Cudgel now has the proper effect
- Added "Recommended Level" equal to the current item use level for the 
several items. All of these items require the player to be level 51+ to 
equip them and/or use their effects. Setting the "Recommended Level" 
field like this just lets the player know what level they need to be to 
use the item. The actual utility of the item was not affected in any 
way, this change is purely informational
- Several items have been changed to be not useable by Iksar. They had 
been erroneously set as Iksar useable in the last item patch. These 
were primarily items that were usable by Beastlords (and were therefore 
changed to allow all Beastlord races to use them), but that had been 
specifically restricted from use by Iksar due to their inherent armor 
value

** Zones **

- Shades in Umbral, Maiden's Eye and Vex Thall are now considered 
undead
- Placed portals to and from Great Divide and Nexus
- Added many new items to better round out the rewards for high-level 
Luclin encounters

** Horses **

- Implemented horse trade in quests. There are now four stable hands 
who will buy back specific colored bridles located in the stables in 
the Bazaar
- Being stunned will now stop players on horses. Not stopping them when 
stunned was causing warping and other bad things
- Knockback spells, and spells that throw you into the air, now affect 
people on horses properly
- Horses now levitate when their rider should.
- Fixed a bug that was causing the client to crash when attempting to 
follow someone while on a horse. /follow should also now work when the 
person you are following is on a horse

** Spells **

- Wizard Familiar spell scrolls will now increase in purchase cost with 
the spell level
- Several spells will no longer be interrupted, spells such as the 
'proc' generated by Instrument of Nife
- Several spells that were not functioning in the planes have been 
fixed and now work in the planes 
- Bards should now gain singing skill when singing and should no longer 
gain skill in an instrument when they are not using one.
- Characters are no longer damaged by damage shields when using 
throwing weapons
- Atol's Spectral Shackles has had its casting difficulty reduced
- Made some changes to Nature's Recovery to make it more stackable

** Visual Issues **

- Wolves and warders should no longer appear to be very small
- Characters no longer lose their hair or beard when their illusions 
wear off
- Weapons should now appear properly (sometimes they wouldn't show up 
at all) when a player zoned in
- Characters in wolf or bear form (or other races that aren't player 
races) should no longer have parts of them tinted based on the armor 
the player was wearing
- Bear form should now look correct to people that zoned in after the 
spell was cast on them
- May have fixed the problem with extra mouse cursor showing in game
- Fixed a problem with NPCs, PCs and some objects not being visible in 
some zones (Wakening Lands, Plane of Growth, Emerald Jungle and Swamp 
of No Hope)

** Performance Issues **

- More work on reducing zone times for Luclin city zones
- "Hitch" created when player characters enter a zone should be gone 
now
- Fixed a bug that could cause the client to crash in some cases where 
a character tried to purchase an item from a vendor but didn't have 
enough money
- Characters with pets that zone (horses, familiars and warders) should 
now be able to zone from North Qeynos to Qeynos Hills

** New Features **

- Holding shift while clicking the resolution in the options in game 
will reduce the resolution. If you are already in 640x480 though, this 
does nothing. Normal click increases the resolution as it always has 
and still wraps back to 640 after the highest resolution your machine 
supports.
- Using 1280x1024 and 1600x1200 resolutions, the /wincolor command, and 
getting the inventory window in fullview mode are now available to all 
EverQuest players (these features were restricted only to Velious 
owners) 

** PvP **

- It is no longer possible to bandage others of the opposing deity team 
on Sullon Zek

** Alternate Advancement Abilities **

- Lowered the reuse time on Rampage AA ability from 15 minutes to 10 
minutes
- Rampage is now fixed. Previously was only hitting one target
- Mass Group Buff button should work properly when zoning
- Casting Reinforcement should now work on all buffs cast, not just 
those cast on yourself
- The Discipline Duelist should now be doing the correct damage when 
using Chaotic Stab
- LifeBurn should now reset properly after being interrupted
- Dire Charm should now reset properly after being interrupted
- Fixed the Quick Buff ability to work as described
- Leech Touch should refresh properly now
- Exodus and Nexus Gate now have a casting time of 1/10th of a second

February 1, 2002
------------------------------

On Monday the 5th we'll be making a change to the way our Live and Test 
patching works.

A little while ago we combined our Test patcher with our Live patcher. 
The intent was to remove the confusion that having two patchers can 
cause and to encourage more people to play on Test.

Well, we're going back to the old way. We are going to split the Test 
patcher and the Live patcher back into two separate programs.

This means that in order to access the Test Server you will need to run 
TestEverQuest.exe, which you will find in your EverQuest directory. To 
play on the Live Servers just start EverQuest as you always have.

There are a few advantages to separating the two patchers. Splitting 
them up makes it a little easier, as a player, to be sure that you are 
headed to the right server when you double click the icon. It's also a 
little more intuitive for those that want to run the game in two 
directories.

Using two directories for EverQuest does use up a lot of hard drive 
space. However, for those with enough space that play regularly on both 
Test and on Live servers, this is a safer and faster way to work. Using 
the same directory means that each time you change servers (Live to 
Test or Test to Live) you will have to patch. The data on the Test 
Server is very rarely the same as that on Live servers.

And for us internally it makes it easier to test new patchers. It gives 
us one more step for testing. Now we can push a patcher to the Test 
Server and try it out there after internal testing and before it goes 
to the Live servers.

In any case, we've decided to move back to the old way. Starting on 
Monday, February 5th, 2002 you will need to run TestEverQuest.exe to 
patch and play on the Test server, and Everquest.exe to patch and play 
on the Live servers.

* Patch Message Addendum *

The command line argument "/test" should no longer be used to play on 
the Test Server. Anyone using this should remove this argument from 
their shortcut. Please manually select "TestServer" from the Advanced 
Options window to use the Test Server. On Monday, February 05, 
TestEverQuest.exe will once again be used to patch and play on the Test 
Server.

** General **

inordinate amount of time

after servers or zones are brought up. This is designed to provide a 
fairer distribution of these NPCs across all time zones

it will not fit into your inventory, the item will simply appear on

five, whether the player is on-line or off-line or any combination of 
the two

the expansion, and therefore will no longer move you to the 'safe

command (or at least enough of it to distinguish it from the owner)

that charmed them casts invisibility

longer affect items that are marked solely with the No-Drop flag. No-

** Tales **

Grand Master Glox sat silently staring into the black waters of the 
Cabilis aqueducts, his thoughts tracing and retracing the recent 
visions that had upset his nights. The Lord Cazic was trying to tell 
him something, but he could not yet decipher what it was. The hand on 
his shoulder startled him and he turned quickly, striking the intruder 
with a quick blow to the chest. The figure crumpled to the cold ground.

Glox stood over him with a look of horror, it was one of his own pupils 
he had struck. He lay bloodied and bruised at Glox's feet breathing 
heavily with much effort, he was obviously dying. The pupil reached up 
toward Glox with something in his hand. Glox took the items from his 
hand and peered at them intently. There were two items, one was a 
glistening serpentine scale, the other an ancient stone symbol. Glox 
recognized the symbol almost immediately with horror. It was the symbol 
of the Soriz, the ancient Iksar tribe that had been the slaves of the 
Shissar empire. Glox looked down at his pupil again. "Where did you get 
this?" The dying Iksar used his last ounce of energy to point up toward 
the night sky and the moon of Luclin. "sSs... Ssraeshza... has... 
returned..."

- Fixed a bug that was causing some people to crash when repeatedly 
right-clicking spell gems

people grouped that were applying less than 100% of their experience to 
the Alternate Experience pool.

- Fixed stacking issues with Circle of Seasons and Talisman of 
Epuration

- Wild Lord's armor effects are now level restricted

- Fixed a bug with necromancer pets that was preventing them from

NPCs.

** Patch Information ***

- Fixed a problem with Alternate Advancement ability Combat Fury that 
was causing rangers using archery and rogues using throwing to have a 
lesser chance to critical than normal. This did not affect warriors

- We think we've fixed many of the issues that were causing 1018 
errors. At the very worst players should be able to log back in faster 
now 

- Fixed a problem that was causing quests to give no Alternate 
Experience to a character when that character had all experience going 
into their Alternate Experience pool

and Breastplate of Day to show a negative statistic modifier

- Fixed an issue with some ATI-based video cards that was causing the 
inventory screen to flash

- All Levitation spells will now be stripped when entering a no-
levitation zone. There was a bug that caused the game to only strip the 
first Levitation spell found

messages

Maidens eye

slot (was errantly flagged for the chest slot)

** A Tale **

Prime Heirophant Vek leaned over and looked into the jeweled case 
silently. The young mystic behind him nervously fingered the cudgel 
hanging from his belt. He knew what was coming. The hold of the 
faceless had firmly taken hold of his heart and was beginning to 
squeeze.

Vek turned to him quietly and simply said, "Find them." He then walked 
silently out of the room.

Hierophant Zand turned to the young Mystic, "Do as he has asked. Do not 
return until you have the skulls of the ancients in your possession." 
The young Mystic stumbled as he ran out of the room, visibly shaking.

Zand looked down into the empty skull case. Something glittered softly 
in the corner of the case. Zand reached in and picked up a small 
earring, emblazoned with the symbol of the Kunzar.

Zand walked quietly out of the room, and somewhere the soul of a dead 
emperor laughed with unholy malice.

** Another Tale **

Halor slashed frantically at the creature before him. He swung down 
hard, cleaving the great worm in two. Unfortunately there were many 
more were that came from. Bauric climbed over a rock and stood next to 
Halor, fighting off another of the worms.

Halor suddenly felt a sharp pain in his right heel and spun violently 
around, causing his journals to fly out of his pack and onto the hard 
stone floor. He swung at the worm larva with his sword knocking it 
away, but too late. The worm had wounded him badly, he could no longer 
hold himself up on the wounded ankle and he fell to the floor with a 
crash. Bauric cried out in pain as one of the larger worms bit into his 
arm. That was the last thing Halor saw before the horde of worms 
squirmed across the stones and overcame them.

- Improved the way that Abolish Disease/Poison and Counteract 
Disease/Poison work 
- Fixed it so that whenever a player loses the chance to click on a 
resurrection dialogue box (such as entering the inventory screen), the 
game will react as if the user had clicked "no". This should prevent 
cases where the player can not be resurrected unless they logged out 
- "Sense" spells should now work while on a horse

and the component removed 
- Skin of Shadow has had its night only restriction removed

- Vyzh`dra the Cursed has been adjusted to help balance the risk versus 
reward associated with the encounter 

** Items **

- Wand of Casual Blessings is not longer usable by Half-Elves, and is 
usable by Dark Elves and Gnomes. It also now looks like a staff and not 
a bag

type are no longer displaying a graphic (as intended) and the 
'customized' plate helms should all now have graphics (also as 
intended) 
- Custom Malevolent Crown should now be the same color as the rest of 
the armor set

- Shield of Auras should now have a graphic 

** Combat ** 

- Pets are now more likely to avoid NPC ripostes 
- Wizards now have an inherent chance to score a critical blast with 
their damage spells after 11th level. This ability does not lessen the 
chance of scoring a critical hit with Alternate Experience abilities 
that grant criticals 

** Client/Interface ** 

- Added /dopropertinting command. This command allows you to turn on 
and off the "DoProperTinting" option in the eqclient.ini file. 
Activating this command should correct most tinting issues (such as 
armor tint also tinting the character's skin). But if it causes issues 
you can toggle it off by using /dopropertinting off 
- Added /chat commands, that allow players to create their own chat 
channels. Please read the eqmanual_supplement.doc in your EverQuest 
directory for more information 
- Added /hitsmode command. This command allows you to more finely 
control how you see hits, including seeing them in a window other than 
your chat window. Please see the eqmanual_supplement.doc for more 
details 
- Added /clearhits to clear the current hits in the M2-M5 modes of the 
/hitsmode command. Again, please see the eqmanual_supplement for more 
information 
- Added /showgrass command. This toggles the radial flora (Luclin only) 
on and off 
- Added options in the Options screen (under Chat Filter) for filtering 
out Melee and Spell criticals. Options are All/Me/Off. These can also 
be activated using the /filter command, and will affect critical hit, 
critical blast, exceptional heal, and crippling blow messages 
- Changed /filter to allow you to toggle the various chat filter 
settings (still also lets you toggle the badwords filter) 
- Changed /channel to allow you to set your default chat channel. It 
also now saves this setting in the INI file 
- Changed the /targetgroupbuff command to be 'persistent'. The state of 
the switch will be stored in the eqclient.ini file and will be 
remembered when you log out or zone 
- Fixed the double messages received when "Soandso's song ends" 
- Mend should be working properly. "Can not use Mend for x seconds" can 
still appear, but you now should be able to use mend at the appropriate 
time 
- Fixed bug in the client that caused a "You are out of Ammo message" 
even when you still had ammo 
- Messages should no longer be lost while you are zoning 
- Corpses that are made to appear at the "safe spot" of a zone for any 
reason can now be moved using /corpse as long as the person using the 
command has /consent for that corpse 
- Added "AllLuclinPcModelsOff" line to the eqclient.ini file which, if 
set to TRUE, will skip the loading of all of the Luclin PC models 
(except the Vah Shir, which always gets loaded no matter what this is 
set to). This should allow players to set the loading of each race and 
sex individually for their normal game play, but then quickly turn all 
models off for a raid or other such circumstances 
- Added /rtarget function (can be used as /rt). This function targets 
the last character to send you a /tell. It follows all of the rules for 
/target 
- Messages sent to you while you are zoning should be saved and sent to 
you when you reach the other side of the zone. Messages should no 
longer be lost while zoning (unless zoning takes more than about 10 
minutes for any reason) 
- You should be able to keep typing whatever you were in the middle of 
typing when you zoned... but it might not be processed till you're in 
the new zone 
- If someone is on your ignore list and they do a /random, you 
shouldn't see it anymore 

** Pathing ** 

- Corrected some pathing in Ak'Anon that was preventing some NPCs from 
reaching certain areas 
- Corrected some pathing issues in Acrylia Caverns 
- Corrected a problem with the entrance from Hollowshade Moor into 
Paludal Caverns that was preventing Beastlord Warders from entering the 
zone 

** Miscellaneous ** 

- Many cases where characters would stab themselves with their weapons 
when sitting should have been eliminated.
- Player characters no longer broadcast their location when they are 
stationary. This should reduce the resources used and improve gameplay.
- Fixed a problem that was causing some users to see blocky, unblended 
terrain where terrain types meet.
- Critical hit messages from spells now take into account PvP damage 
calculations. The actual damage was calculated correctly, it was just 
displaying wrong on the critical message.
- Fixed canoes, they should move forward and backwards normally again.
- We have been working to prevent characters from being stuck in the 
game after link death in such a way that prevents the player from 
logging back in. Players should be able to log back in no more than 5 
minutes after going link dead in all situations.
- Added Sharvahl as a "home zone" for Vahshir when taking PvP racial 
faction hits into account .
- We have fixed the ATI flashing problem that some players with certain 
cards were having when inventory window was up.

message to not display

player to be displayed even if you had other's hits off

- Added another option to the /hitsmode command to allow users to force 
the windows to be displayed even if empty 

New Hitsmode Usage: /hitsmode    
   
    

Where:  is 1 to force the window to draw even if empty. 

- Changed it so hitsmode windows do NOT draw when in "normal" old UI 
mode (e.g. spellbook) 

- Fixed a bug that was giving bards an error message related to 
/targetgroupbuff every time they zone. ("This ability does not work 
with bard songs.")

*** News from the Vale ***

Clan Death Fist has long had a minor presence in the Misty Thicket, 
preying on the Halfling farmers and tradesmen. Recently the Death Fist 
Clans numbers in the thicket have increased and the Orcs are cutting 
down trees and mining the rock of the nearby mountains. Reports have 
come in to Rivervale that the Orcs are shipping the lumber and ore to 
the commonlands and stockpiling it for an unknown purpose. Whatever the 
Deathfists agenda, their increased presence has made the thicket a more 
dangerous place beyond the protective wall. 

Not far from the tunnel that leads from the Misty Thicket to Rivervale 
lie mysterious cursed ruins. All that remains of what once stood at 
these sites are fragments of walls that are presumed to have been 
constructed around the same time as the nearby ruined tower. An ancient 
magical scarecrow stands at the center of one of these ruins and warns 
passers by that the place is cursed. It is a popular belief among the 
halflings of Rivervale that the crumbled walls once surrounded 
beautiful and fruitful gardens that were cursed when their owner and 
caretaker offended the Gods. Whether or not this story is true, the 
scarecrows warning is true as the gardens are host to diseased vermin 
and the animated corpses of fallen halflings who were brought to the 
there and buried after their death by an unknown evil.

With the Goblin Clan Pickclaws now occupying a portion of Runnyeye 
Citadel the number of Goblins now residing in the Misty Thicket has 
grown. These somewhat exiled Runnyeye Goblins have been mining Crude 
Iron Ore from the nearby mountains and are most likely attempting to 
forge weapons and armor to use in a goblin revolt to reclaim all of 
Runnyeye Citadel from the Pickclaws. With enemies to all sides these 
semi-exiled goblins are being far less troublesome than they have the 
potential to be.

------------------------------

NOTE: We are unable to patch "code" right now because we are in the 
middle of making some changes to the basic structure of the game. This 
will delay fixes for system bugs and updates (such as Alternate 
Advancement Abilities and /commands). Please be patient until we can 
get these much-needed changes finished. Because these changes affect 
things such as the database that stores player characters, we're taking 
care to make these changes the right way.

.....................................................................

------------------------------
May 8, 2002  3:00 am
------------------------------

out of charges after the patch. Players with such items will need to 
petition and ask a GM to swap the item out with a new one

working as intended
- Focus items that affect a spell's duration should now work for

skill

go invisible, Abscond or Evac

the spell series

spell casting messages for people in their group and they will also see 
when member of their group are hit with spells

** Spell Stacking **

General stacking changes: Some buffs were not being allowed to stack 
which now will stack, and other buffs were being allowed to stack which 
should not have. 

For example, many stacking problems with spells that have a See 
Invisible or Levitate component are now gone (e.g. Dead Man Floating), 
while a number of stacking exploits that granted too much regeneration,

illusion

AA abilities

reduction
- Casting deftness was changed to reflect the increases presented by 
the in-game help (5, 15 and 25%)

pets. The text should correctly say that there is only one level for 
this ability

slightly improve the functionality of the Evade skill
- Poison should no longer be interrupted

disparity between melee and caster effectiveness in the zone

able to get you started on your way 
- Added Mortar and Pestle to a Thurgadin merchant
- Rubbing Alcohol is now available from a vendor in Thurgadin

** Guilds **

- Fixed many bugs with the guild system, for example: GMs can now 
rename guilds without the need to destroy and recreate them, guilds can 
have names that share the first 15 characters with another guild (they 
couldn't before) and people should no longer experience random guild 
kickouts when a guild on their server is deleted/reformed.

** Pets **

- A character may now have a horse, a pet and an Eye of Zomm at the 
same time
- /pet attack range has been limited to prevent its use as a targeting

the INI file

- Made some adjustments to factions to make Beastlords, Druids and 
Rangers (as well as small adjustments for Vah Shir) a little better 
liked by animals (those that don't adhere to a faction)

resources. We've also increased the rate that position updates are made 
by moving player characters, using up some of those saved resources but 
making movement a bit smoother
- Stationary NPCs should no longer warp when they aggro/summon
- NPCs who shout names while they Death Touch should be fixed

more. Affected zones are Nexus, Skyfire, Emerald Jungle, Butcherblock

and Lavastorm
- Fixed the bug that was preventing players from seeing the "your spell 
is interrupted" or the NPCs spell interruption message

the zone after zoning

after zoning)

** Sullon Zek Rules Change **

We have increased the number of character that can be created on an 
account to three. These characters, however, must be on the same team

** Firiona Vie Rules Changes **

Since the launch of Firiona Vie we have had tremendous support for this 
special server from players who want a very roleplaying immersive 
environment. Players have made numerous suggestions to tweak the 
ruleset a little more. We have taken many of those suggestions and made 
changes accordingly. 

We will be keeping the following rules intact: 

* /ooc will remain unavailable to remind people that acting in 
character is strongly recommended. 
* The Common language will remain out, to help maintain the feeling of 
race-based community and to allow people to continue to roleplay 
someone with a native tongue. 
* The Trivial Loot Code and all of the special rules for no-drop items 
will remain. This has worked out nicely for the sense of community on 
the server. 
* The one character per account restriction will remain.

However, we will be removing the following restrictions:

* Anonymous/roleplay flags will no longer be required. They will remain 
available, but forcing anonymity on characters was causing undue 
problems finding groups and other such things that are essential to 
enjoyable gameplay. 
* The language learning limit/speed restrictions will be removed. While 
the idea of limited languages seemed like a good idea, this is another 
item that was just making it too hard to actually play the game. 
Roleplayers that don't want their characters to be overly literate 
always have the option to play their characters that way. 
* /shout and /auction have returned to unrestricted use to allow easier 
grouping and selling. People are welcome to filter those channels if 
they prefer not to see them, but the benefits of having them availabe 
is just too great. /ooc will remain disabled on this server. Obviously, 
acting in character on any channel is strongly recommended. 
* Alignment restrictions has been removed. Forced restrictions for 
grouping make playing the game too much of a chore. Characters, 
however, may always decide who they wish to group with based on any 
factors the character perceives. If your Dark Elf won't group with a 
paladin, he doesn't have to (and shouldn't). If your cleric of 
Quellious wants to heal a necromancer because healing people is the 
right thing to do for him, then you should be able to do so. But not 
allowing these things is a restriction on your ability to play that 
character 'in-character', and a real hindrance to general gameplay.

Again, it's important to understand that this is still a roleplaying 
preferred server. The rules that we are changing were often as much of 
a restriction to one's ability to roleplay as they were a help. And the 
artificial barriers to grouping, especially the trouble created in just 
finding a group, needed to be removed to allow people to actually play 
the game.

songs.
- Corrected issues with a few of the recently added trade skill 
recipes.

** Gameplay **

- In hopes of providing more things for more people to do, certain raid 
level encounters in the world now return to existence a small amount 
faster than they used to. This was actually included in lastnight's 
patch but was not mentioned.

- To address the competition between epic-seeking bards and other 
classes, the infamous White Dragon Scale is no longer used in the quest 
given by Karam Dragonforge in Rathe Mountains. The quest now requires a 
White Dragon Hide. We did not reduce the rate at which White Dragon 
Scales enter the world, but rather added new potential for the new 
White Dragon Hide to be found.

** Focus Items **

- Spell casting time foci should report their new casting time 
properly.

- Spell duration foci designed to affect DoTs (the Affliction line) 
should now work reliably.

- Spell duration foci affecting beneficial spells are no longer random. 
They now always extend the affected buffs for their maximum. (We never 
wanted to make it harder to time your buffs.)

- The Affliction focus line should now only be affecting spells that do 
damage.

- Bards should no longer get focus item messages that weren't actually 
affecting them.

- We've re-assigned quite a few of the focus items to have their 
originally intended effect. 

All of the same items have focus effects. However, as many people 
noticed, quite a few effects were mis-assigned due to a tools error. 
(Common, mid level items were frequently being assigned high level 
effects, and vice versa.) 

This situation has been fixed, and the items now have the effects that 
we originally planned for them.

** Firiona Vie **

- Your server should once again have Trivial Loot Code enabled. Sorry 
for changing the rules on you.

** Chat Channels **

- Should once again work reliably for people who are using NAT or IP 
Masquerading via certain networking devices.

stackable
- Brick of Deathsteel Ore is now stackable
- Several blacksmithed cultural armor set pieces have received a slight 
improvement to their armor class.

*** New Interface Available *** 

The new EverQuest user interface is now available for use on Live 
servers. Many of you will find that it runs faster than the old 
interface. It is extremely customizable, and offers all sorts of 
features including resizable windows, fading windows, a pet control 
window, and flexibility through the XML files. We decided to offer it 
for optional use as a sort of Beta II for folks on the Live servers 
that haven't had the chance to try it out on the Test server. 

To activate the new interface: 

* Log into the game. 
* Type /newui into the chat bar and hit enter. 
* Log out and exit to your desktop and then log back in. 

or 

* Before you log in: 
* Open the EQclient.ini file in your EverQuest folder with a text 
editor (notepad works fine) 
* Find the [Defaults] section of the file 
* Add a line that reads: NewUI=TRUE 
* Log in 

We want to thank all the folks that have helped us test the interface 
and have offered a wide variety of useful ideas. 

Enjoy the interface! 

*** Bazaar Now Available *** 

Those of you that own Shadows of Luclin now have access to the /bazaar 
and /trader functions. These functions only work in the Bazaar. You can 
find the Bazaar on Luclin, adjacent to the Nexus and Shadowhaven. 

/bazaar opens up the Bazaar Search Window, which allows you to easily 
locate specific items for sale by Traders in the Bazaar. /trader opens 
up the Bazaar Vendor window, which allows you to make items available 
for sale to others in the Bazaar. 

You can only use the Bazaar if you have the new interface turned on. 
See the message above for details. 

Again we'd like to thank the folks that helped us test this feature. 
And we'd like to apologize for the delay in delivery of the Bazaar. 

We think that you'll find the finished product to be a good one. 

** ViewPort ** 

One of the new commands available only with the new interface is 
/viewport. You can use this command to change the size of the gameplay 
area. 

/viewport [distance from left, distance from top, width, height] 

All of the distances and numbers for the viewport command are in the 
same measure as your screen resolution numbers. 

For Example: Let's say you are running in 800 x 600 video mode and you 
want to create view the game only in the top half of your screen (not 
that you would). You would type: 

/viewport 0 0 800 300 

The top left of your screen is 0 and 0. 800 is the width of your 
screen, and the 300 is one half of the height of the screen. 

/viewport reset - will reset the viewport to the default setting. 


** New Vah Shir Models ** 

We have developed new models for the Vah Shir for use with the old 
world. You may now choose to turn off the Luclin version of the Vah 
Shir models and use these new models if you wish. These new Vah Shir 
models require less memory and you may want to use them in place of the 
Luclin models to improve system performance. 

** Spells ** 

- Fixed a bug with the bard songs Warsong and Battlecry of the Vah Shir 
that caused them to slow you down when used without other haste 
components. - Fixed a bug with bolt spells that caused double hits due 
to elevation. Sorry Mages. 
- Removed the "Ahhh... I feel much better now!" message from certain 
spells when the caster is over level 35. 
-Removed the reduction in damage to Damage over Time spells when used 
on NPCs that are moving. 
- Mind Wrack will now consider the z-axis when calculating the maximum 
distance group members can receive the beneficial affects of the spell. 
- Song of Sustenance should prevent unnecessary hungry and thirsty 
messages. 
- Bind Affinity can no longer be cast on any ungrouped player in 
arenas. 
- The caster of Voice Graft will once again see what is being said. 
- Spells that transfer hit points over time from the caster to a target 
will no longer take effect on the target (the hit point gainer) if the 
caster (the hit point giver) isn't also affected by the spell. 
- Added a spell effect message to Magician epic. 
- Beastlords now get Endure Disease at level 24 and Resist Disease at 
51 

** Pets ** 

- Pet Resistance Changes: Pets will now use their master's level and 
resistances when saving against spells cast by NPCs (against PCs pets 
will use their own resistances and level as they always have) - unless 
the pet has special resistances, in which case it will use that 
resistance. 
- Altered pet summoning spells so that they always summon the most 
powerful pet possible, instead of pets within a 5 level range. 
- /pet report health now uses the same user defined color as spell 
text. 
- /pet report health will now display a list of the effects on the pet. 
- Mage fire pets should now cast their damage shields more often. 
- Wizard, Druid and Cleric pets and familiars can now be buffed by 
characters other than their owner. 

** PvP ** 

- Fixed a bug on Tallon and Vallon Zek that made player characters in 
non-human illusions immune to ranged attacks. 
- It is no longer possible for PC's to fear other PC's at all on any 
server. The same was also done for charm. 
- Pets can no longer be affected by charm spells. This should fix the 
issue that caused charm spells to make pets disappear. 
- NPCs who are pets of players and call for help from other NPCs will 
have their cries fall on deaf ears. 

** Alternate Advancement ** 

- Dire Charm will now send a message to inform the caster that the 
charm has broken by Feign Death. 
- Spell Casting Subtlety should work properly for all levels of the 
ability. 

** Zone Specific ** 

- Corrected a problem with a treasure table in Marus Seru. 
- The drakes in SkyShrine should no longer be dropping cloth caps. They 
should now be producing Drake Eggs. The drakes are very happy about 
this. 
- The mountain lions in Steamfont now have jawbones. They are happier 
about this than the Drakes are about their eggs. 
- Hoshkar should no longer appear as a bag, qualifying him as the 
happiest of them all. 

** Horses ** 

- Fixed a bug that was allowing characters to change into illegal forms 
while on horseback, causing some unusual displacement problems. 
Characters will no longer be able to turn into those illegal forms 
(elementals, for example) while on a horse. 

** Quests ** 

- Corrected an issue with the Proudfoot Greaves recipe. 
- The Vex Thal key quest has been changed slightly. Celestial Rifts 
will no longer be used to create the key - a new item replaces them 
called a Planar Rift. Planar Rifts are acquired by defeating the same 
creature as before, however all future Rifts are going to be No-Drop. 

A Celestial Rift can be placed in a forge by itself and 'combined' to 
create a Planar Rift. Please be aware that the new Planar Rifts are No-
Drop, and should only be converted in a forge by the intended owner. 
Old-style Celestial Rifts may be converted into the new Planar Rifts 
for a period of one month from this patch. If you have any rifts 
currently, be sure to convert them to the new style within 30 days. 

This change is not intended to make it more difficult or time consuming 
to acquire your Vex Thal key. Many players had brought forth concerns 
regarding the ability to hoard Celestial Rifts, which had the potential 
of causing some long-term issues. This fix addresses those concerns, 
and does not add any difficulty for players currently working on this 
quest. 

** Items ** 

- Shissar-bane bows should be working. 
- Irontoes Tipped Beer Stein should now look like a stein rather than a 
bag when equipped. 
- The Intricate Shield can now be used by Dwarves, High Elves, Iksar, 
Vah Shir, Barbarians and Half Elves. 
- Imbued Steelsilk Helms now have plate graphics. 
- Large Fine Plate Boots can now be worn by Bards. 
- Crustacean Shell Helm now has a graphic. 
- Pickbringer's Chainmail Boots are now wearable by Gnomes. 
- Forged Firebrand Halberd now has a halberd graphic rather than an axe 
graphic. Also, because it is a two-handed slashing weapon, it can no 
longer be used by Bards. 

** Dialogues ** 

There were a few NPCs that were not responding properly to their quest 
text. This has been fixed for the following NPCs: Wizard Schrock, 
Seamey Whirewhisker, Oglard, Morgalanth Tal`Raeloen, Verona Rankin, 
Gunex, Waltor Felligan, Nallar Q`Tentu, Lord Nethryn and Cilin 
Spellsinger. 

** Miscellaneous ** 

- NPCs no longer have a chance to break root when being healed or 
buffed. 
- /split no longer has a chance to cause a loss of coins if done while 
a group member is gating. 

** Grouping ** 

We have revamped the grouping system. This is a major rewrite of the 
system that should have little effect on gameplay, with the exception 
of removing the bugs with the old system. Players should no longer have 
issues with their group due to the link-death of any member (including 
the leader), zoning and other such issues. There is also a new command 
available. 

/makeleader - The leader of the group can now reassign who the leader 
of the group is by use of this command. 

*** News from Faydwer *** 

It is rumored that the major cities of Faydwer have announced a call to 
arms for all young adventurers. News of mysterious bloodthirsty goblins 
to the west setting up encampments has prompted all residents of 
Kaladim, Kelethin and Felwithe to all begin preparing themselves for 
what they think may be a momentous battle. Intelligence originating 
from the Scouts of Kaladim and Kelethin has informed their respective 
leaders of a possible alliance between a mysterious aqua goblin tribe 
and the Orcs of Clan Crushbone. Due to the possibility of an attack by 
either or both of these powerful tribes, guildmasters of all cities 
have begun the training of young soldiers brave enough to heed the call 
to defend their homeland against all unknown creatures and new 
inhabitants. 

*** Call to Arms *** 

Tarlain moved along through the tunnel at a brisk pace, a wistful smile 
painting his weathered features. His arm reached out from under his 
travel stained greatcloak so that his hand could traced the side wall 
of granite while his mind recalled the many times he had passed through 
this tunnel in his youth. It had been many years since and the memories 
of his training in the woodland ways within the environs of Surefall 
glade filled him with a peaceful nostalgia. 

This nostalgia all but vanished as Tarlain rounded the final curve and 
broke into the tree filtered sunlight of Surefall Glade and beheld a 
most unexpected sight - a line of Qeynos foot soldiers marching past 
the Ranger hall and on toward the far end of the Glade. What could 
bring the forces of Qeynos here? Knowing this could not bode well, 
Tarlain strode quickly to the Ranger hall, his eyes on the receding 
backs of the footmen. 

Reaching the main hall entrance, Tarlain's sight latched on to a 
proclamation inked in the flowing hand of a Qeynos scribe and bearing 
the seal of Antonius IV. It outlined the rising threat of Blackburrow 
Gnolls invading and despoiling the previously sequestered Jaggedpine 
Forest. Because of this danger Antonius has lifted his father's ruling 
to protect those forests and now calls for able-bodied men and militia 
to join in quelling the expansion of the vile Gnolls. Gritting his 
teeth at the thought of Gnolls invading the pristine woodlands, Tarlain 
turned and with a hand on his longsword, set off to catch up with the 
guardsmen and throw in his lot against the dogs of Blackburrow. 

(Note: Jaggedpine Forest is only available by using the optional files 
download option in the advanced section of the EverQuest patcher. Be 
aware that the download required for this new zone is relatively 
large.)

Mastery
- Corrected an issue with bard charm songs
- Various other fixes. :)

------------------------------
September 4, 2002  3:00 am
------------------------------

Please note: there are a lot of changes going into the game with 
today's patch. Some of these changes (such as the changes to 
resistances and spell stacking) will change aspects of the game that 
may make gameplay different. Keep this in mind when you log in. With 
system-wide changes like these it is entirely possible that there are 
still bugs. Please report these bugs using /bug, and know that we will 
work to fix them as fast as we can. But also note that some intended 
changes might appear as bugs (perhaps a spell no longer stacks with 
another spell). Feel free to report these as bugs if you are unsure. 
But please keep in mind the changes listed here as well.

** Petitions **

- /viewpetition displays the petition you have in the queue, if any.
- /deletepetition deletes the petition you have in the queue, if any 
(unless that petition is currently being viewed by CS staff).

** Keyrings **

We will be resetting all keyrings with this patch. This will mean that 
all existing keys in the keyrings will be removed. You will need to 
place keys back onto the keyrings. Keys are added to the keyring by 
using the key. The keyring is a part of the character, not a space in 
inventory. To find out what keys you have just type /key and the game 
will give you a list. If you have recently deleted a key, please 
contact your GM for a replacement.

** Experience Changes **

- We have smoothed out level progression from 50-60. This should 
mitigate the "penalty effect" that occurs in levels 51, 54 and 59. Note 
that it will cost the same experience to level from 50 to 60 as it did 
before. Also, death experience loss will appear different in some 
levels. This is an unfortunate side effect that must remain to prevent 
some experience exploits.
- We have rebalanced the rewards for killing NPCs for characters over 
level 50. NPCs that are considerably weaker than you will give you less 
experience. NPCs give more experience the higher level they are, and 
for the best results you should fight the most challenging monsters you 
can reasonably manage. 

** Spells **

- Fixed the "You have been healed for X damage" message. It once again 
reports the actual amount of damage healed.
- Added a message telling the caster when NPC can't be charmed.
- Fixed a bug with duration boosting Alternate Advancement abilities 
and foci that was only allowing the first 12 buff slots to be modified 
as opposed to all 15.
- Fixed a bug that was allowing focused and Alternate Advancement 
ability enhanced damage spells to do more damage than they should 
(meaning that both the Alternate Advancement and the Focus improve the 
base damage. The focus damage was never supposed to compound with the 
added AA damage.)
- Enchanter spells that have a hit point component and a stun component 
can now be partially resisted.
-The Enchanter "visage" series has had their recast time reduced to 
make them more useful.
-Shadowknight and Necromancer Drain type spells can now be clicked off 
by the recipient of the beneficial portion of the spell. For example; 
Shadowknights and their group members can now click off the effects of 
spells such as Torrent of Hate. While the target of spells such as 
Shadowbond can click it off if they so choose. 
-Torrent of Hate should no longer overwrite Call of the Predator

- Repaired some problems with Beastlord stat buffs - specifically that 
the higher level ones weren't always better than the lower level ones.
- Furious Strength made available to Beastlords at Level 54
- Dexterity made available to Beastlords at Level 57
- Stamina made available to Beastlords at Level 57
- Divine aura is now available to Paladins at level 51, instead of 
level 55.
- Harmshield made available to Shadowknights at level 51
- Augment Death made available to Shadow Knights at Level 60
- Death Peace made available to Necromancers at level 60
- Flaming Sword of Xuzl has casting time reduced from 6 to 2.5 seconds, 
recast increased from 2.5 to 60 seconds and mana cost lowered from 600 
to 250.
- Unswerving Hammer of Faith has casting time reduced from 6 to 2.5 
seconds, recast increased from 2.5 to 60 seconds and mana cost lowered 
from 600 to 250.
-Added a new line of spells for Shadowknights, Voice of Darkness. 
Merchants in Echo Caverns have been able to appropriate many of these 
new spells, but Voice of Terris has so far eluded them.
-Added two new Mesmerize type spells for Bards, one at level 40, and 
one at level 58. Rumor has it that Serilia Whistlewind has recovered 
the melody written by Sionachie, but has been unable to locate the 
transcript for the Dreams of Ayonae.
-Whispers in the taverns of Katta Castellum speak of recently 
discovered Ancient melodies. Brave adventurers search far and wide for 
the song of the ancient combine empire, and the Lullaby of Shadows.

- Higher level PCs will be more resistant to lower level NPCs' spells.
- Increased the number of spells that can be in effect on a given NPC 
to 30.

** Spell Stacking Changes **

We've made two changes to the way spells stack.

Damage Over Time (DoT) spells are spells that linger on the target 
doing damage. Until today two different characters could not have the 
same DoT spell on the same target. As long as one copy of the spell was 
active any new version of the spell would not take hold. After today 
the same DoT spell cast by different casters can affect the same target 
at the same time. Also, if you cast a DoT spell on a target and you 
already have that spell active on it, the spell will refresh. (Note: It 
will not be possible to stack Lifeburn).

This does not allow for inferior spells to stack along with superior 
spells. (Example: Two Necromancers can both land Boil Blood on the same 
target. However, Heat Blood, being an inferior spell, will still not 
stack.)

Several DoT spells that have debuff components such as Tuyen's Chant of 
Frost and Breath of Ro will not stack due to the balance issues of 
having several hundred points of Resistance debuffs on a single NPC.

We've also rewritten the way that spells stack with other spells with 
the same benefits (for example, to spells that give bonus hit points). 
Generally speaking spells may now 'bounce' off each other (neither 
overwriting the other) and stacking issues should now be easier to 
resolve. In specific:

- Warder's Protection should have considerably fewer stacking and 
overwrite issues. Thanks to the folks at the Ranger's Glade for all of 
their help in 'tracking' this down. 
- Druid Damage Shields should now all stack in the correct order. 
- Druid HP buffs are no longer overwriting stronger cleric HP buffs. 
- Harness of Spirit and Visions of Grandeur should interact a bit more 
sanely. 
- Existing effects should no longer be stripped off when the incoming 
spell isn't going to take hold. 
- Boon of Garou and other illusions now interact the right way.
- Spells that have both group and single target versions (and no 
special coding to tell them otherwise) now mutually overwrite each 
other.

** Resistance Changes **

We've made some fairly drastic changes to the way the spell resistance 
system works. Previously, there was only the smallest benefit to having 
resists over a certain value. We've reworked resistance in its 
entirety, completely replacing the old system with one that is more 
logical.

The idea behind the changes is pretty simple: Resists should matter in 
a way that makes sense.

Important things to note about the new resistance system:

- Resists matter more for PCs. There are now tangible differences 
between having 50, 150, and 250 in a given resistance, for example. 
Resistance buffs, bard songs, and resist gear have actual value, all 
the way up the line.

- Conversely, resistances also matter more for NPCs. Some NPCs became 
more vulnerable to things they have always been vulnerable to, other 
NPCs became more resistant to things that they were inclined to be 
somewhat resistant to. 

- Resistance debuffs should also have more value, all the way up the 
line. For the first time, resistance debuffs now have the ability to 
bring NPCs that were lure-style only down into the range of being hit 
by normal spells.

- The hard level limit involving players casting on NPCs has been 
removed. This used to be referred to in EQ folklore as the "Six Level 
Limit" (It was actually 1.25 times the caster's level, but more people 
likely thought about it the other way.) This means that in the vast 
majority of cases, there is at least a small chance that a person will 
be able to connect a spell with an NPC, even if they are out of that 
NPC's traditional level range.

- Overall, against NPCs that have medium-to-high resistances of a given 
type, expect to see more full hits, fewer partials, but more full 
resists in the new system. Taken over time, the damage done by PC 
casters to semi-high resistance NPCs should be approximately the same, 
but will definitely improve when the proper debuffs are applied (we 
wanted to make sure that this did not turn into a universal nerf of 
casters).

We look forward to seeing how these changes play out in front of a 
larger audience. 

** Line of Sight Changes **

- For spells that require Line of Sight (LoS), the LoS check is now at 
the beginning of the spellcast, not the end.
- Spells that require but do not have of LoS will now fail immediately.
- Harmful spells require LoS.
- Most Beneficial spells still do not require LoS.
- Bind Sight type spells do not require LoS.
- Any beneficial spell containing a Cancel Magic component requires 
LoS.

** Priest Changes **

- Clerics gain the Bash skill beginning at level 25. They will have a 
maximum skill of 125 at level 50, 165 at level 60.
- Clerics gain Hammer of Judgement - a level 56 summoned hammer with a 
powerful and frequent proc effect
- Clerics gain Yaulp V - a level 56 self-only melee and mana regen buff 
that adds haste, dexterity, mana regeneration and stamina regeneration.
- Clerics gain Ethereal Elixir - a level 60 group version of Celestial 
Elixir, the heal-over-time spell.
- Clerics gain Ethereal Light - a level 58 upgrade of Divine Light, the 
single target heal spell.
- Clerics gain Ethereal Remedy - a level 59 upgrade of Remedy, the 
single target heal spell.

** Sound and Music **

- We've started work on the sound and music engine. If you used to have 
sound/music bugs, the first upgrade today might help a bit. This is the 
first step down a long road. If your particular sound/music issue isn't 
fixed, please be patient. There's no need to re-report existing 
sound/music bugs.

** Items **

- Items now display level-restricted statistics besides armor class and 
damage as a red number with the unrestricted value in parentheses.
- Duration focus items now give focus message when a group spell lands 
on caster.
- Blessed Coldain Prayer Shawl has been given a minor upgrade.
- Small Cloth Sandals are no longer wearable by large races.
- Fixed the Plane of Mischief boxes.


** Pets **

- Changed Specter pets so they're able to equip items and armor.
- Pet-only buffs now automatically attempt to target your pet if you 
cast them with the wrong target or no target at all.
- Fixed a bug that would prevent the creation of Familiars and Warders 
if the caster had created more than 99 in the same zone during the 
current game session.
- The limit on the amount of haste that can be applied to a pet has 
been changed (aka. The Pet Haste Cap). The amount of haste that can be 
placed on a pet now scales with the level of its owner. The scaling 
occurs in a way that is consistent with how much haste a given caster 
can place on his own pet (using a Level 56 Magician as an example: The 
idea is that both Burnout IV and Muzzle of Mardu should be useful).

** User Interface **

- Deleting Spells from Spellbook: Storebought spells can be deleted 
from your spellbook. To delete a spell just right-click it to highlight 
it and tap the DELETE key. Please note: This does not convert the spell 
back into a scroll. You will have to buy a new scroll if you wish to 
re-scribe the spell. No reimbursements will be made for deleted spells.
- Item Links: When you inspect an item with Alt-Left-Click, the item 
inspect window stays up. To paste a "link" to the item you're looking 
at into your chat bar, click on the item's graphic. That will "speak" a 
link that others can click on to see the stats of the item, as if they 
were inspecting it themselves.
- Updated the /note window. The old /note command still works as it 
always has. But you can now use /note without additional text to 
produce a text window for entering note text. The /note command window 
should not break existing skins.
- Fixed a bug with the tracking window that was showing the sorting set 
for something other than normal for non-rangers (this was just a visual 
bug).
- Fixed a bug that sometimes caused a crash when zoning with the corpse 
window open.
- Added UI Label type #74 = Player Title
- "Reply to" will properly prepend a ;tell in front of names that are 
from other servers.
- Extended the "reply to" queue to 50 names.
- Fixed some aesthetics with labels. Percentages will never show above 
100 now (even during a heal). Corpse HP will always show 0.
- There will now be sound when banking coins.

** Bazaar **

- Added Focus Effect search parameter to the Bazaar.
- Items that are no-drop on other servers but tradable on Firiona Vie 
should now show up in Bazaar searches on that server.

** Alternate Advancement **

- Frenzied Burnout no longer makes the pet suicide after the buff's 
duration ends.
- Fixed a bug that would cause the Dire Charm ability not to reset if 
an enchanter used it when he already had a pet.
- Fixed a bug that was causing Dire Charm to not give the "this mob 
cannot be Dire Charmed" message or reset the timer in Cazic-Thule.
- Added the Quest Completion sound to AA point dings.

** Quests **

- There is a fellow named Moltak in Sol Temple. Killing him gives a 
negative faction adjustment with the True Spirit faction. BUT, if you 
have a very, very bad faction with True Spirit, killing him will also 
reset your faction to a more tolerable level. So don't mess with this 
fellow unless folks on the True Spirit faction are willing to kill you 
on sight.
- Made some modifications to the faction effects of the Wizard Epic 
quest.
- A powerful warder has been seen in the Skyfire Mountains. Those who 
seek retribution against Ragefire would be wise to speak to her, she 
may be able to provide information about his whereabouts.

** Miscellaneous **

- Merchants now display up to 80 items in their inventory. There should 
also be less delay when opening up merchant windows.
- The Help window will now be displayed on startup. This will happen 
only if it has never been seen before (since this change).
- Sirens should have female voices.
- Bloodgill Goblins should now sound like goblins.
- Several spell caster guild masters are now teaching magic skills. In 
Shadowhaven: Palomidiar Allakhaji, Loewnsaz_Waldalon and Lamukas 
Kaesoanls. In Echo Caverns: Kelador, Celerik, Wirgus and Yurian.
- Erudites of Prexus now start at the proper location. 
- Bards singing songs should no longer prevent group members from 
/split'ting coins. Only teleportation spells being cast in group will 
prevent /split'ting. This change was required to keep coin from 
disappearing if a /split occurred while a person was in the process of 
leaving a zone.
- Leather Padding can now be made from Rockhopper Hides.

** Planes of Power Pre-Order Bonus **

If you pre-order the PoP expansion you will be able to purchase the 
Planes of Power original soundtrack CD for just an additional $4.95.

*** Important Notice about Alternate Advancement ***

- When a character has 30 or more AA points, they will receive a red 
message stating:

Warning: You are currently over the earned Advancement point limit of 
30. Please spend some of your stored AA points. You will not be able to 
earn further AA points until you have fewer than 30. On October 21, 
2002, all points over 30 in your AA pool will be deleted.

It seems appropriate that Advancement points earned prior to the 
release of Planes of Power be used for abilities from earlier 
expansions. In addition, many of the Luclin abilities are pre-
requisites for Planes of Power abilities. When the servers come up on 
October 21st, all unused Alternate Advancement point pools over 30 will 
be wiped.

** New Spell Effects **

We are implementing a few new spell effects using our new particle 
effects engine with this patch as a way of easing into the new system. 
The new effects are faster and give you more control over how they 
look. We have changed the Display Options menu to accommodate these new 
options.

On the Display tab of the options window you will now find four options 
regarding particle effects. The first three, listed under Spell 
Particles are Near Clip Plane, Density and Opacity. These are the 
options for controlling the new particle effects. They will not change 
the old particle effects. The old particles are controlled using the 
Other Particles option.

Note on Near Clip Plane: This option chooses how close to you particles 
cease to be visible. So Near allows particles to be seen right up to 
the character. Farthest will clip out particles near the character and 
only show those at the 'farthest' distance.

Note on Opacity: This feature works at all settings for cards that 
support TnL. For other cards setting Opacity to 0% will turn off the 
effects and any other setting will show them fully.

We'll leave it up to you to discover which spells have the new 
particles...

** Alternate Advancement **

- Beastlords now have access to the Mend Companion ability.
- Beastlords now have access to three unique class alternate 
advancements.
- Permanent Illusion used with Wolf Form should no longer result in a 
wolf tinted by the Enchanter's robe.
- Updated Finishing Blow - 
"This ability gives you a chance to finish off an NPC that is below 10 
percent health and fleeing with a single blow. The first level works on 
NPC's below 50, the second on NPC's below 52, and the third on NPC's 
below 54. (Non-Warriors must first train one level of Combat Fury to 
use this ability.) "
- Improved Combat Fury for non-warriors to give more value to the 
points spent after level 1.

** Spells **

- New Druid and Shaman heal spells are available.
- The "Your XXX Spell Has Worn Off" messages for DoT spells will now go 
to the right character.

werewolf, will no longer cause the character to be naked when the 
illusion drops.
- Fixed the Illusion wolf form swimming animation.
- Shaman and Beastlord Shrink spell has had its location restriction 
removed.
- The outcasts of Echo Caverns have deciphered new magics that allow 
Dark Knights to channel the essence of terror into their enemies minds. 
While their initial findings have proven very powerful, rumors exist of 
even greater magics that might channel the nightmares of Terris Thule 
herself into the minds of mortals. Where that power might be found is 
not yet known.

** Items **

- Items that grant bonuses to bandage skill should be working now.
- Guise of the Hunter no longer makes the user appear to be naked.
- Validus Custodus Battle Axe no longer looks like a bard mandolin when 
equipped by a pet. 

** PvP Servers and Gameplay **

- The recent resist changes have been adjusted for PvP. They will not 
be exactly as they were prior to the resist change, but they should be 
reasonable now. Please let us know if you feel they need further 
adjustment.
- Player characters will no longer lose experience in the Arena areas 
on the Sullon Zek server.
- A player character can no longer tell his pet to attack another 
player's horse when not on a PvP area or in a duel.
- Kael, Skyshrine, and Thurgadin on Sullon Zek no longer have the 
newbie protection code active.
- Players should once again be able to use level-restricted clickable 
buffs on the Sullon Zek server.

** Pets **

- Improved Beastlord pets to scale more reasonably with the level of 
the Beastlord after level 40. This also puts them into line with the 
last round of pet balancing, which did not improve beastlord pets at 
the time.

** Horses **

- Locate corpse songs/spells should now work on horseback.
- Detect traps should also now work on horseback.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing manipulation of inventory items if a 
character died with coins on the cursor.
- Invisibility on horseback should now make your horse invisible to 
NPCs as it does the rider.
- Zoning with Levitate/Levitation and horse no longer causes the 
levitation to fail.
- Fixed a bug that would cause the horse 'buff' to disappear when 
zoning in some zones. 
- Player characters on horseback can now be hit by various missiles, 
such as arrows, thrown weapons or the various bolt spells from PCs and 
NPCs.
- Call of the Hero should no longer put people under the world when the 
caster is on horseback.
- Dragging a corpse while on a horse will no longer cause the corpse 
fall under the world.
- You can now right click on spells to arrange your spell book when on 
a horse.

** Zone Specific **

- We believe that we fixed the major source of lockups caused for 
players in certain zones such as the Great Divide and Shadowhaven.
- Hierophant Oxyn in East Cabilis will be showing up again.

targetable.

** An Ancient Arises **

Deep within the recesses of a cave yet unknown to the world at large, a 
dark, menacing figure parts with the slumber that has kept him silent 
for ages. The eyes of a magnificently ominous beast pierce through the 
darkness, his memories flowing freely once more. In the depths of this 
beast's mind sparks the knowledge that his prophetic savior has been 
released from the ancient magiks of time, let loose upon an 
unsuspecting world where the kin shall once again reign supreme.

"My master's shackles have been trounced, and so it is written that in 
this world that has been so deftly overrun by pitiful mortals, he shall 
bring power back to those of the scale." The deep rumbling voice of the 
beast lingers throughout the cavernous hideaway, the barely 
distinguishable figure of a mighty lizard moves through the stone and 
dirt and dust as if to leave the gloomy surroundings and find his place 
once again upon Norrath proper.

"For far too long have I been a prisoner to the overwhelming might that 
kept me in a state of secluded sleep; for far too long have I been 
victim to the ancestral elemental forces keeping my master at bay. Now 
I awaken and bring life back to the disciples; now shall the lifeblood 
of the Four once again spread the word of prophecy!" The footsteps of 
this great beast are slow but sure, moving through the depths of the 
gaping mountain retreat towards the surface. Along the walls, pebbles 
and stones that have remained dormant for years crumble and crack, 
falling to the ground as the immense beast walks past.

A maze of dead ends and broken paths twists and turns in the expanse 
beyond the figure's resting place. The skeletons of those who had tried 
- and failed - to make their way to him in the years he spent in forced 
slumber remain, tumbled landmarks of heroes long lost. Slowly he moves, 
his reptilian eyes darting back and forth looking for any meager meals 
that may still be available. As he proceeds, he steps atop a mighty 
echelon, overlooking the bodies that could not defy the magical 
properties of the cave; fools of mortal thought, incapable of fathoming 
the power that lay beyond them. "Time has been good to you, my faithful 
warren... let us both pray that I no longer need you. The time for the 
revival is at hand."

.....................................................................

** Odd New Objects in the Land **

Folks across Norrath and on Luclin have reported seeing odd new objects 
in various locations. They appear to be some sort of magical portal, 
though local spell casters have yet to discover how they arrived or 
exactly what their purpose is. They have determined, however, that 
these objects are slowly building in power. Attempting to use these 
portals at this time can have unexpected results. Experts recommend 
that adventurers avoid these objects until they know more. For more 
information on these odd devices, visit www.planesofpower.com

** Important Notice Regarding Alternate Advancement Reimbursement **

Due to the changes made to Manaburn, Rods of Mystical Transvergence and 
a previous change to Innate Regeneration, we are reimbursing several 
Alternate Advancement (AA) abilities. 

Once you log in today, if you have any of these abilities, please check 
your AA window immediately! If you have more than 30 unspent points, IT 
IS VERY IMPORTANT that you make certain that your character has 30 or 
fewer AA points before The Planes of Power launches on October 21st! 
The return of these AA points may put your total number of unspent 
points over the 30 point maximum. Your pool will be reduced to 30 the 
first time you log in after the launch of Planes of Power on October 
21st. 

We will be refunding all Alternate Advancement points in the following 
abilities: 

Innate Regeneration
Manaburn
Mental Clarity
Quick Summoning 

Refunded Alternate Advancement points may be spent in any way you 
choose. None of these abilities is being removed, and of them only 
Manaburn is changing.

NOTE: Cannibalization, Gather Mana, and Mind and Body Rejuvenation will 
not function if you do not have the necessary prerequisite, Mental 
Clarity 3.

** Alternate Advancement **

- Mana Burn will only land any given target only once every minute. If 
a cast of Mana Burn is unable to land, the timer will not be used.
- Spell Casting Mastery once again works in the same manner that it did 
before the previous patch
- Spell Casting Fury and Soul Abrasion will now stack
- Illusion Tree and Minor Illusion will no longer be affected by 
Permanent Illusion
- Fixed Purify Soul. It should now cure poison, disease, damage over 
time spells as initially intended
- Reduced the reuse timer on Divine Resurrection from 72 hours to 36 
hours
- Reduced the reuse timer on Mend Companion from 144 minutes to 36 
minutes
- Reduced the reuse timer of Warcry from 72 minutes to 36 minutes. 
Increased its duration from 5 seconds per rank of the ability to 10 
seconds per rank of the ability

** Defensive Changes **

- Decreased Monks' ability to mitigate damage (please see the 
Developer's Update on www.everquestlive.com for more details)
- Improved the ability of Paladins, Shadowknights, Warriors and Bards 
to mitigate damage in some situations
- Upgraded Warrior dodge cap to 190
- Upgraded Paladin, Shadowknight and Bard dodge cap to 170
- Upgraded Ranger and Beastlord dodge to 170 and defense to 240

** Spells **

- Complete Healing will now heal a maximum of 7,500 hit points
- The Rod of Mystical Transvergence spell has been altered. The spell 
has been renamed to "Mass Mystical Transvergence". When cast, this 
spell summons a Rod of Mystical Transvergence for everyone within 300 
feet. This rod is no drop and contains 3 charges of Mystical 
Transvergence. Each charge restores 360 mana at the cost of 450 health. 
A player may only use a charge from the rod once every 5 minutes.
- Additionally, there is a new "Rod of Mystical Transvergence" spell 
for sale in the Bazaar. This is a single target spell that summons a 
rod with 3 charges of Mystical Transvergence. This rod has the same 
abilities and restrictions listed above. This spell is a targeted 
summon that costs 400 points of mana to cast.
- Changed the way Focus stacks with other strength and dexterity buffs
- Circle of Seasons will overwrite Resist Cold
- Dance of the Blade should now stack with McVaxius's Rousing Rondo
- Harness of Spirit and Rage should now stack properly
- Fufil's Curtailing Chant should now stack with Occlusion of Sound

Risen
- Blessed Armor of the Risen should now stack with Lunar Whispers

attacks from great distance to go unnoticed by NPCs
- Contact Innates (such as Boon of the Garou) should now be working for 
bards
- Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause helmets and sometimes hair to 
disappear after an illusion was cast
- Bard songs should now blink on recipients other than the bard

** Encounters **

Due to the number of Luclin encounters requiring original Rods of 
Transvergence to be defeated by a reasonably sized force, a number of 
those encounters have been be re-tuned to shorten their duration.

** Interface **

- New Alarm feature added. When you first log in you will see a pop up 
asking if you wish to set an alarm and if so for how long. There is 
also an option to choose to never see that pop up again. If you choose 
this option you will need to set ShowAlarmWindow=TRUE in your 
eqclient.ini file in order to see the pop up again. The alarm will 
trigger after the time you set has elapsed, no matter what character 
you are playing on whatever server, up until the moment you log out.
- /played now displays how long you have been playing this session and, 
if an alarm has been set, how long until that alarm sounds.
- /pet sit down should now work on charmed NPCs
- Added 3 new context menu options for chat windows: Reply To, Tell a 
friend, Tell a Raidmember (for future use). Each of which has a submenu 
containing the list of Reply targets, Friends, or Raidmembers, as 
appropriate. Clicking on the player's name will place "/tell " on the 
chat entry line, and move the focus there, closing the menu.
- Changed /loadskin. It now brings up a window that will allow you to 
select a skin from a list, determine whether to use the INI or not, 
then load the skin.

** Beastlords **

In order to allow us to better tune warders, we have made changes to 
the way that these pets work. Previously a Beastlord would summon a pet 
using an ability button and then use level-appropriate buff spells to 
increase the pet's level. Because of the way this mechanic works, it 
was very difficult to tune these pets. Hopefully this will have the 
side benefit of making things a little easier on Beastlords by reducing 
the number of steps required to cast the pet.

Beastlords will now summon their pets using spells rather than an 
ability. The series of spells that was previously used to buff the pets 
will now simply summon the appropriate pet.

Unfortunately, these pets will no longer zone with the Beastlord, and 
will need to be resummoned (instead of rebuffed) after zoning.

We have made some adjustments to these pets already. 

- Added the casting time reduction that is already in place for 
Paladins, Rangers and Shadowknights to Beastlords

** Items **

- Merchants now highly value the Staff of Forbidden Rites and will only 
sell them at an extremely high price.
- Dance of the Blade should once again stack with Nature's Melody and 
Song of the Deep Seas

** Trade Skills **

- Made it slightly easier to get skill increases while doing Tailoring, 
Tinkering, Smithing, Baking, Brewing and Alchemy. Made it slightly more 
difficult to get skill increases with Pottery and Fletching


** Miscellaneous **

- Fixed an issue that was causing zones to crash in some circumstances
- Fixed an issue that was causing merchants to behave erratically while 
handling certain quantities of items
- Player Character corpses with no items will decay in 3 real life 
hours, not 7 days
- Fixed a bug that was causing Lay Hands to not heal enough damage
- Zoning while on a horse on a boat will no longer cause you to appear 
on the other side in the water
- /face (face picker) will no longer work while under the effects of an 
illusion
- Taunt should be more effective and more dependent on the level of the 
Taunt skill for PC's and NPC's below level 60.
- Levitation can no longer be cast on Traders in the Bazaar

** Fan Faire **

Greetings Norrathians! The portal to the San Francisco Fan Faire has 
been updated to include a full schedule, forums, hotel information and 
more. Registration is still open but the reservations are going fast. 
If wish to join the fun, teleport over to: 
http://everquest.station.sony.com/fanfaire/ to reserve your spot and 
see what's new! Those of you who have already registered, we'll see you 
on the weekend of November 8th in San Francisco!

.....................................................................

------------------------------
October 17, 2002  3:00 am
------------------------------

- Some NPCs were unable to cast Area Effect spells and other innate 
abilities. This would have caused many of the recently retuned NPCs to 
be considerably easier than intended. 

- Updated the range on the Magician spell Rod of Mystical 
Transvergence. 

- Rods of Transvergence and Modulation Rods can no longer be used by 
those who do not have enough maximum hit points to survive the mana 
conversion. Please note: That is MAXIMUM hit points! It is still 
possible for appropriate level characters to rod themselves to death. 

- Barbarian Beastlords will once again return to summoning their own 
dogs. Not someone else's. If you were summoning a dog that didn't 
appear familiar, please do not worry. Your own dog has returned. He 
missed you. Please feed him. 

- Altered the stacking for the Shaman spell Voice of the Berserker to 
match the other spells in its line. 

- Aura of White Petals has been updated to have its strength as it was 
prior to its stacking changes. 

- In the original patch yesterday morning, /SHIELD was added as an 
innate ability that all Warriors now gain at level 35. Warriors may now 
choose to take a portion of melee damage that is intended for another. 
Warriors, please type /SHIELD for a full description of this ability. 
You may find that it assists you greatly in your groups. 

Correspondingly, NPCs and Pets over level 30 who are Warriors were 
granted this ability as well. Certain NPCs and Pets may choose to 
protect beings that they have an affinity for, if they believe that it 
will benefit the shielded being. For now, however, there is not yet a 
way to manually cause or prevent this behavior in pets.

** Patch Information ** 

- Fixed a number of bugs associated with the new sound system. If you 
were having troubles yesterday and disabled sound and music, please 
feel free to give it another try today. 

- NPC sounds should no longer clip out too fast. 

- The Sound Realism slider in the Options window is once again working. 
Turning it all the way off will disable Reverb, as the old /reverb 
command used to. 

- Quieted down people's personal sounds (sounds that you hear yourself 
making) a few notches. 

- In minor updates throughout yesterday, also addressed a number of 
spells whose effects were no longer making their usual noises. 

- Assorted content tweaks.

.....................................................................

------------------------------
October 25, 2002  3:00 am
------------------------------

- Added a toggle command for combat music called /combatmusic 
- Sounds that fade out will just fade back in if restarted (instead of 
fading out and starting over as before). This should make combat mode 
toggling much more pleasant 
- Added /mixahead command. You should only use this command if you are 
experiencing sounds skipping. The default value for this command is 8. 
Basically, this command tells the sound engine how far ahead to pre-mix 
your sound. The larger the number the further ahead it mixes. So if you 
are experiencing skipping, you may want to try increasing the mixahead 
value in small increments (increase it by 2 or 4 at a time). A setting 
of about 16 is probably as large as you should need, greater than that 
will cause your sounds to be noticeably delayed. 
- Swarm and Reanimation-type pets no longer give exp when killed 
- Swarm and Reanimation-type pets now properly credit their leader when 
they kill an NPC 
- Fixed an issue with /raid that was causing some folks to crash 
- Fixed a bug that was allowing players without Planes of Power to be 
invited to /raids 
- Added minimum and maximum price search parameters for the Bazaar 
- Fixed a stability issue on the servers

.....................................................................

------------------------------
November 5, 2002
------------------------------

- Monk fists as hand-to-hand weapons now scale to 15 damage/20 delay at 
level 65. 

- Corrected a bug with a few spells that were group or ranged but would 
only work on the caster. 

- Corrected faction issues with some form changes (illusions). 

- Fixed the Magic and Stealth manual quests in Plane of Knowledge. 

- Changed how Force Shield, Barrier of Force and Manaskin interact with 
Beastlord mana regeneration spells.

.....................................................................

------------------------------
November 14, 2002
------------------------------

- Addressed an issue with the Vallon Zek encounter.
- A certain Ogre in Drunder now returns a vial of blood under the 
correct circumstances.
- The Ring of Torden should now function correctly.
- Experience rewards have been increased in Plane of Storms to bring 
the zone more in line with the effort required, and also more in line 
with other planes of the same tier.
- The servers were not reset for this update.

** Zones ** 

- Spectral Parchments, Ethereal Parchments, and Glyphed Rune word drops 
have been increased significantly in the third tier Planes of Power 
zones. 
- The trials within the Halls of Honor have been changed slightly. 
Please proceed with caution. 
- Several Planes of Power NPCs are no longer angered quite as badly 
when they notice a healing spell being cast on a player they are angry 
with. 
- Made improvements to the Planes of Power quest armors. 
- Assorted quest, item, and dialogue fixes. 

** Planes of Power Zone Progression ** 

As most know, progressing through Planes of Power zones requires that 
certain tasks be performed. In many cases, one of the tasks required 
involves being on a raid that defeats a particularly powerful foe. 

One side effect of this progress is that if the tasks were not 
accomplished in a particular order, a person on a raid may not gain the 
flag for completing the event, as they did not complete the 
prerequisite tasks. 

The majority of "zone boss" style encounters in the first three tiers 
of Planes of Power zones have been changed to allieviate this problem 
of completing tasks out of order. 

As of today, if you defeat one of these foes and do not have all of the 
prerequisites completed to receive the flag at the end of the event, 
you will be able to go back and complete the tasks that you have not 
yet performed. 

Once you've done that, you may speak with the Seer in the Plane of 
Knowledge who will make sure that you are then able to progress as if 
you had performed the tasks in their proper order.

** Demise of the Classic/Velious Interface ** 

Over the last six months we have been keeping the Classic EverQuest 
interface as well as the Velious interface working through all of the 
features that we have added (built-in MP3 player, item links, compass, 
enhanced /bug reporting tool, and others). However, with the release of 
some of the new features in this patch, such as running EQ in a window, 
we must now say goodbye to the older interfaces. They have been 
disabled as of today. 

They served us well. 

** EQ in a Window ** 

EverQuest can now be run in a window. To place EverQuest in a window, 
simply press Alt-Enter. You can also switch out of EverQuest to another 
program by using the familiar Alt-Tab. It is important that you do not 
do this until you are in-game, do not do this during the login process. 

It is important to note a few things. Running the game in a window may 
reduce game performance a bit. And, as always, the more programs you 
have running at the same time the more resources they use. 

At this time, due to some changes that need to be made on the front 
end, it is not possible to run two instances of EverQuest. We will be 
working to make the necessary changes over the next few weeks. 

** Songs Window ** 

We have added a new window to the interface along with new game 
functionality. The Songs window is a new buff window that holds up to 6 
bard song buffs. This increases the potential maximum effects that a 
character can have to 21 (15 standard and the 6 new ones). The new 
window only holds certain bard songs (generally the 3-tick songs). Only 
beneficial songs will qualify for the new buff box, and not all of 
those. Any buff in the new Songs window is considered temporary and 
will not be saved when you zone. 

Songs that qualify to go into the new window will go into that window 
first. Any qualifying songs over six will be rerouted to the main 
Effects window. Cancel Magic effects will see these new buff slots as 
buff slots #16-21. 

Note for User Interface skin creators: The Label EQTypes 80-85 are the 
Songs window song names. 

- Some magical effects on Planar class armor have been altered. In most 
cases the effects were upgraded, but a few items were given weaker 
effects that were more in line with the difficulty of obtaining them. 
- Fixed a bug that was causing a few Planes of Power NPCs to take too 
long to respawn. 
- Wu's Attack should now work correctly. 
- Incoming damage now interacts with Wrath of the Wild and other rune-
type spells in their proper order. 
- Pact of Shadow and Shadow Compact will once again heal player 
characters. 
- Charmed Pets will no longer remain charmed after the owner dies. 
- Sending special characters via EQIM will no longer 
freeze the game. 
- Hitting Autoattack when in explore mode at Character Select will no 
longer cause the game to crash. 
- The Loadskin window will now load skins other than the default 
properly. 
- Fixed and issue that caused some NPC's text to be cut short. 
- Fixed (but did not rename) the Broken Golem. He should no longer be 
hated in Fear, just feared... 
-Lowered the duration of calm-type spells that effect creatures level 
50 and over.

*** Announcing The Legacy of Ykesha *** 

The Legacy of Ykesha will be the first download-only extension for 
EverQuest. This product will not be available in stores. This extension 
will include some great new gameplay features, as well as new zones for 
characters ranging from level 35 up to level 60. 

Legacy of Ykesha Features include: 

A new playable race: Frogloks 
Enhanced Looking For Group Tool 
New Cartography System 
New Magic Item slot: Charms 
Armor Dyes 
Dozens of new creatures 
Expanded bank capacity 
New zones 
New spells 

For more information, please visit www.legacyofykesha.com 

** Gameplay/Features ** 

- With our last patch and the patch today, we've significantly reduced 
the amount of bandwidth that EverQuest needs to use, even in large raid 
or extremely-crowded-zone situations. 
- Fixed a problem with tints not properly updating when armor is 
removed. 
- Fixed a bug with character faces displaying incorrectly to other 
players when you zone in after them. 
- Fixed resurrection timer that was counting down against the 3 hour 
limit when player was not logged in. 
- Corrected a problem with health and movement updates being delayed. 

** Spells ** 

- NPCs will now notice Druid and Shaman Percentage Heal spells in a 
manner similar to traditional healing spells. 
- Removed the chance for slow spells to be reversed from the 17 NPCs 
that had this ability. 
- Fixed a bug that was preventing Curses, Diseases, and Poisons from 
being removed. 
- Raised all recast times below 2.25 seconds up to 2.25 seconds. This 
is a change in the spell data as the first part of a two-part change 
needed to correct the "Recast time not met" problem. More information 
is available at the Developer's Corner at www.everquest.com. 

** Alternate Advancement/Special Abilities ** 

- The range on the Bard Ability "Boastful Bellow" has been increased 
slightly. 
- Fixed a bug with Harm Touch that was not allowing it to increase the 
standard amount per level over level 60. 

** User Interface ** 

- Fixed a bug with effects in the Songs window. They were not getting 
removed on the client when the bard was dispelled. 
- Introduced new Story window. The purpose of this window is to provide 
story updates in a readily available location. ALT-N toggles the 
window. You can select to have the window pop up when new story 
elements are added if you wish. 
- Item Links are once again creatable from Items and from other Item 
Links. Please do not attempt to "mine" the servers for undiscovered 
items. Links now have a built-in mechanism to prevent those who would 
go on fishing expeditions by sending up many bad links in an attempt to 
discover new items. These invalid links are logged, as are the accounts 
of those who create them. 
- Added an optional confirmation box before spending AA points. To turn 
on this confirmation box, please check the Options window. 

** Miscellaneous ** 

- Sage Quests in Plane of Knowledge have been fixed. 
- The event to fight Bertoxxulous in the Crypt of Decay will reset 4 to 
6 hours after the event is failed. It will respawn normally if the 
event is won. 

** New/Changed Interface Files ** 

- EQUI_StoryWnd.xml (actually added with the Jan. 9th patch) 
- EQUI_OptionsWnd.xml

** ANNOUNCEMENT **

The response to The Legacy of Ykesha(tm) extension has been 
overwhelming; we want to thank all of you who have pre-ordered.

In order to better serve ALL of our customers, including those who do 
not have a credit card, we've decided to make a relatively small number 
of The Legacy of Ykesha CD-ROMs available at retail as well. Please 
note, though, that The Legacy of Ykesha CD will likely not be available 
at retail in the US until as much as a week or more after the "live" 
date; the delay may be longer for our international customers.

If you have already pre-ordered from us, but you would prefer to wait 
for the retail CD, you can cancel your pre-order by following these 
instructions:

1. Go to the Station Store (https://store.station.sony.com/)
2. Go to Billing Info and sign in.
3. View Current pre-orders.
4. Click Cancel button; you will receive a cancellation email.

You may still pre-order the digital download version of The Legacy of 
Ykesha from the Station.com Store (the download version only - we will 
not be selling CDs through pre-order) for the special pre-order price 
of $17.99.

** Gameplay and User Interface **

to describe the value of this change, but it should show a noticeable

delays that can occur when a new player enters a zone.

purchase an item or close the merchant window just as he was leaving 
the trading range of that merchant.
- Players should no longer get out of range message when trying to 
target a player on a horse just because the horse has moved a little 
(but is still in range).

now.
- Merchant's Crate of Supplies will now fit into containers that can 
hold giant-sized items.

** NPCs **

- The specters and shades in Velketor should no longer be dropping 
cloth armor.
- Centi Dators should no longer spawn inside walls.
- Oozing Flesh in the Tower of Frozen Shadow should no longer drop 
Sabretooth hides. It was determined that these creatures are too slow 
to catch a Sabretooth, and that they do not have the ability to skin 
them nor the desire to wear (or eat) their hides.

- Fittorin Bladespur will now respond properly to hails.

use and looked like the base model human (Doug).

** Character Appearance **

- The bald head can now be selected during character creation by 
clicking the left arrow button (was only available by clicking the 
right arrow).
- Beard color selection now works for dark elf male, high elf male, 
half elf male, and dwarf female during the creation of new characters. 
Note: Dwarf female only has one style of beard.
- The ability to pick a wode is now available at character creation for 
Barbarians.
- Choosing the "random" button at character creation will now randomly 
choose a face rather than always using the initial selection.

Note: Some folks have had trouble getting the elves' beard colors to 
work properly. In order to get them to show up, you may need to set 
DoProperTinting=TRUE in your Eqclient.ini file. You can do that by 
typing /dopropertinting in game.

Shadeweaver Portal.

cohorts. He will also become very, VERY angry should he be removed from 
his lair(s). 
- Skyshrine will once again require a key for exit into the Cobalt 
Scar. The fact that the key was not needed was a bug. We do understand 
that few people actually walk through this area considering the other 
methods of transport available, but the dragons aren't leaving their 
doors open.

** Items **

- Corrected the inventory icon for the Acrylia Studded Legs and the 
Two-Handed Practice Sword.

As the afternoon heat grows, a trickle of adventurous folk can be seen 
moving through the rocky vales of the mountains called Stonebrunt. 
These quiet lands, normally inhabited by panda bears and kobolds, are 
slowly becoming a throughway for heroes, mercenaries and adventures of 
all races. Are you one of them? 

And in Gukta tadpoles are growing into young Frogloks. There is no 
doubt in the minds of the conquerors of Grobb that the new generation 
of their people will grow into strong and steadfast servants of 
Mithaniel Marr, worthy of his respect. Will you be one of them? 

OOC: Have fun with the new features, the new race and the new zones. 
Thank you for playing EverQuest. 

Gameplay

We've adjusted the entry requirements for some Planes of Power zones. 
Several of these zones required each character to complete a quest 
before gaining entry. We've relaxed this requirement somewhat as 
follows: 

A raid with 32 or more members can enter a locked plane provided that 
85% of the raiders have finished the entry quest. This means a raid 
group can bring along some friends who haven't completed the quest. 

Characters who haven't done the entry quest must stay with their raid 
while they are in the locked zone. If these characters leave the raid 
for more than three minutes, they will be transported out to the Plane 
of Tranquility. 

Using this method does not grant permanent access to the locked zone. 
If a character wants permanent, unescorted access to a locked zone then 
they must still complete the quest. The goal of this change is to allow 
raiding groups to bring along a few friends who haven't been able to 
complete the quests, but still wish to help with the raid. 

Several of the flagging events will now only give out a maximum of 72 
flags each time they are completed. 

The dialogue boxes for resurrection and translocation will remain for 5 
minutes instead of 1 hour. 

Increased the maximum number of members on ignore and friends lists to 
100. 

Made some adjustments to the Halls of Honor alternate entry quest that 
should make it more friendly. 

The horse buff icon will no longer show up for characters using non-
Luclin models. 

Interface

Containers now close after zoning. This prevents a bug that was causing 
the same container to be opened twice. 

The rogue hide message "You have moved and are no longer hidden!" is 
filtered as a "skill" message and not an "other" message. 

Fixed a bug that was causing the spell effects opacity slider to always 
return to 0% when logging out to the desktop. 

Items

Happy Dragon should no longer use a charge when the target is out of 
range. 

The inventory icons for Trydan's Greaves of Nobility, Deathwatch Sword 
and Wetfang Steak have been corrected. 

Corrected the name of the Drakescale Covered Tunic (was Drakscale 
Covered Tunic). 

The Manicle of Disruption has been renamed Manacle of Disruption. 

See above for Vorshar's Manicle of the Blight. 

Corrected the spelling of Golden Idol of Rodcef Nife. 

The Rantho Rapier is now a piercing weapon, not a two-hand slashing 
weapon. 

The Wand of Mana Tapping is no longer labeled as usable in the 
secondary hand (since it is Enchanter only and could not be used there 
anyhow). 

Quests

Made a change to the way Planes of Power spell quests work. All spells 
usable by more than one class are now obtained from the same level 
quest. If a spell is level 61 (Ethereal) for one class and level 65 
(Rune Word) for another, both will have it as a reward on their 
Ethereal quest. 

Corrected issues with the quest from the Iksar Hermit. 

Corrected a grammatical error in some of Bolli Hillfoot's text. 

Marshal Anrey should be more responsive when talked to. 

The "Bag of Troll guts" is now dropping off of the correct NPC. 

Zones and NPCs 

Removed the ability for PCs to bind in the upper tier Planes of Power 
zones. Binding is allowed in Plane of Knowledge and Plane of 
Tranquility. 

The entrance to the Plane of Fire now requires the appropriate keys for 
entry. 

Gods in the elemental planes now have fixed respawn regardless of zone 
outages. If the god in an elemental plane is up when the zone comes 
down it will still be up when the zone comes back up. If it has two 
days left before its respawn when the zone comes down it will still 
respawn in two days. 

Prior to this patch Rallos Zek was changed, he no longer allows anyone 
he dislikes to stand above the arena. 

Removed a "safe spot" from the Plane of Disease. 

NPCs in the Plane of Justice can no longer be affected by Fear spells. 

Fixed an issue with some level 10 NPCs in the Karanas having about 400 
times the hit points that they should. 

Denizens of Aerin`Dar's lair will no longer be getting angry at folks 
just because they are stomping around on the ground above the lair. 

Puslings now understand how to "enrage" properly. 

Creatures in Fungus Grove will be less likely to ignore people shooting 
them from a distance. 

Mature Arboreans are now plants. Just don't call them that to their 
faces. 

Giant Whiskered Bats in the Qeynos area no longer drop rat skulls. 

Dalin Greskar has given up his hobby of trying to sell blacksmithing 
gear that he doesn't have and has gone legit with pottery supplies. 

Corrected a typographical error in some of Tarnic McWillows speech. 

Firon Dernkal will no longer add a random "t" to the end of people's 
names when talking to them. 

Corrected an error in Eirod Haerod's text. 

It seems as though the troll sent to retrieve the Forge from fallen 
Grobb has returned with Forge in hand. 

Corrected an issue with the respawn of Fennin Ro. 

A Kromzek spy will no longer give a "beta neutral" faction hit when 
killed. 

Spells

Fixed a bug that prevented the owners of charmed warders from 
controlling or re-summoning their warders after the charm breaks. 

Disinfecting Aura has been changed to no longer cure poisonous effects. 
It will now cure disease effects with much more potency. 

Fixed a bug that was causing Bind Sight to fail to land if the 
recipient had exactly 15 other buffs. 

Convergence should not eat its component as often on some types of 
spell failures. 

Corrected the spell book icons for several Enchanter spells. 

Shadeweaver port should no longer place you beneath the world. 

In a previous update, we added a message when a person recasts a charm 
spell on their charmed pet. Recasting charm on an existing pet did not 
actually re-charm the pet, it just failed silently and appeared to 
succeed. The new message is now displayed intentionally in these cases. 
This is not a bug. 

Miscellaneous

Attack text for the Vah Shir when punching now says, "punches" instead 
of "hits" 

Fixed a bug that was causing the reduced statistics to not update 
properly when the character has low hit points or is encumbered. 

Fixed a bug that caused some sale prices for items in the Bazaar 
(mostly those with a lot of 9s) to be invalid. 

The /guildmotd command has been modified. Guild leaders and officers 
can now use this command to set or clear the guild Message of the Day. 
There is a new command, /getguildmotd, that can be used as an 
alternative to viewing the Guild MOTD in the Guild Management Window.

your options window and select the Keyboard Tab. If you select all

** NPCs **

- Undead will begin to spawn again at night in Kithicor.
- Shin Master Grubbus in Gukta will now be more selective about who he

Please include information about your current characters and your level 
of knowledge concerning EverQuest.

** New Plane of Hate **

The new Plane of Hate is now available on Stormhammer. Enjoy!

** Mitigation Change **

We have evaluated the mitigation abilities of cloth and leather 
classes, and have made changes as appropriate. For the most part, this 
change is a reasonable improvement to the ability of monks to absorb 
damage. At some point in the future we may re-examine the mitigation 
abilities of chain and plate classes. At this time, and with this final 
round of changes to cloth and leather classes, we believe that 
something very close to the appropriate balance is in place.

** Pathing Update **

The first part of our work to update the pathing system for EverQuest 
is complete. NPC and pet pathing should be much improved.

** Charm Changes **

- Healing a charmed pet now generates an appropriate amount of hate for 
the healer.
- Charmed pets now take up to one third of the experience for each NPC 
killed. This amount scales down based on the percentage of damage to 
the target that the pet does. Dire charm pets still take the same 
experience they always have.
- Charmed pets are no longer selected as a monster's preferred target 
if there are many players available for the monster to attack instead.
- ALSO (we forgot to mention this before), the resist modifiers on 
several charm spells (such as Beckon, Call of the Arch Mage, Command of 
Druzil and Word of Terris) have been removed, making them a bit easier 
to resist.

** Windowed Mode for the EverQuest front end **

This patch introduces the ability for players to enter windowed mode at 
the EverQuest front end (from the time you log in until you get into 
the game). With this addition, players will be able to run EverQuest in 
a window from the moment they click on the EverQuest icon to the moment 
they log out.

In order to switch to windowed mode on the front end, just hit Alt-
Enter. Note that there are no settings in the eqclint.ini file for 
this, you just have to hit Alt-Enter.

Use Alt-R to release the mouse from the EverQuest window (note that 
once in the game, you need to use Alt-Shift-R to release the mouse).

And, obviously, Alt-Tab will switch between open programs.

We have also added a Tech button that will take you to our Tech Chat. 
This only works in windowed mode, as it opens up a new window to 
display the chat.

** Spells **

- Stoicism now follows the same restrictions as Torpor.
- Trickster's Augmentation and Boon of the Garou can now be cast by 
characters on horseback.
- Fixed a bug that was causing spells with levitation effects to lose 
levitation if cast over a spell that also had a levitation effect.
- Bards now receive their first level song at creation.
- Changed the spelling of "Corpal Empathy" to "Corporeal Empathy".
- Changed the hit by message for Torrent of Fatigue recourse to "Your 
vitality grows."
- Changed the wear off message for Song of Sustenance to "Your hunger 
returns."
- Adjusted the shaman spell Disinfecting Aura to be in line with Pure 
Blood.
- The Necromancer line of heal-over-time spells should no longer 
overwrite Transon's Phantasmal Protection.
- Augment now overwrites Augmentation.
- Brell's Stalwart Shield now has a casting time of 4 seconds.
- Spiritual Vigor now has a casting time of 5 seconds.
- Resurrection no longer gives the "Your strength returns" message two 
times when the negative effects wear off.
- Fixed a bug that would cause other players to see a character with 
default face/hair for their race when they turned off an illusion.
- Fixed bug that could cause beards to fail to reappear when an 
illusion wears off. This may also fix some other appearance bugs as 
well.

** Illusions/Shape Change **

We have changed the way that Illusions and Shape Changes work with 
respect to faction. The new system is a lot easier to understand than 
the old one, so we'll just explain the new one. When changed into the 
form of a playable race, characters are treated as if they were a 
member of that race. When changed into a non-playable race, characters 
retain their own racial factions.

** PvP **

- If a player is moving when using archery against a PvP target, they 
have a reduced chance to hit their target.
- Archery in Player vs. Player combat in now reduced to 66% damage.
- Direct Damage spells in Player vs. Player combat can only do up to 
75% damage of the target's maximum hit points in a single hit. This 
modification is done before resists are taken into account. For 
example, if a player has 1000 hit points when fully healed, no single 
direct damage spell will do more than 750 damage to him in a single 
hit.

** Alternate Advancement **

- Alternate Advancement abilities that grant Stamina gains should now 
update the character's hit points automatically when trained.
- Dire Charm isno longer "used" when trying to affect an NPC under the 
power of a Dictate spell. It will not work, and the power is not 
expended.

** Interface **

- Using the "/book" command with no page argument now closes the 
spellbook if it's already open.
- Added a "Dump" button to Guild Management window. Pressing it creates 
a text file in the EQ directory containing a comma-delimited text dump 
of the Guild Management window. The file name will be the guild name 
with _ instead of spaces, so a guild named "Legacy of Ykesha" would be 
a file called Legacy_of_Ykesha.txt.
- Cross-server tells are now filtered under the "tells" filter like 
same-server tells, and in the same colors.
- Music Player volume no longer decreases when zoning.
- The Journal window and Journal Categories window now close when 
hitting Escape.
- The Map window no longer pops up after zoning if you used Escape to 
close it in the previous zone.
- Hot button names are once again restricted to eight characters. Being 
able to make them longer was a bug, and was causing issues with 
displaying more than eight characters.
- The scrollbar for the Notes window should now update properly when 
the window is resized.
- Added multi-select capability to the Friends List, Music, Journal 
NPC, Journal Text and Journal Category windows. Shift-click selects 
groups of items, Control-Click selects individual items.
- Fixed a bug that was causing the Journal window to lose all 
information since the last save when logging was turned off.
- Confirmation Dialog window now remembers its position.
- The third person camera view #3 no longer resets when zoning or using 
the armor tinting feature.
- Fixed an uncommon crash caused by the Music Player window.
- The LFG button in the Group window now toggles the LFG window.
- Fixed a bug that prevented the attack button from working properly 
when a Centi Warspear was equipped.
- The dialog box for confirmation of a change in video modes now 
remains open for 30 seconds instead of 15 seconds.
- Added a "Show Offline" button to the Guild Management window. This 
determines whether or not you want to show offline people in the 
window, and the setting is remembered when you log out.
- If you sort by anything other than Name in the Guild Management 
window, the window will sub-sort your list by name.
- Changed the promote button in the Guild Management window to only be 
enabled when eligible guild member is targeted (not just selected in 
window).
- Fixed a problem that caused a few people to have the spell particle 
density revert to default off when they logged off.
-Fixed the Map window to remove a method of avoiding the map 
restrictions in certain zones. 
- Added /getguildmotd. This command allows you to see your guild 
message of the day at any time.
- /guildmotd now sets or clears the guild message of the day. If used 
with no text, it clears the existing message of the day. Only leaders 
and officers can use this command
- Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when pressing the U key while in 
explore mode.
- When under the effects of invisibility, a character that hides and 
then moves and breaks their hide also breaks their invisibility. The 
invisibility icon will now disappear under this circumstance so that 
the player knows he is no longer invisible.
- Closing the AA window no longer causes the resurrection notification 
box to disappear.
- Updated the category lists in the Bazaar window to be alphabetical.
- Characters will no longer be prevented from being a trader if you 
quickly click on Begin/End Trader.
- Fixed a bug with the LFG tool that may have been causing some people 
to crash when zoning.
- New colors should no longer be moving from the armor dye column to 
the item tint column when a character is saved.
- Hand to hand weapons now "greys out" the melee attack button.
- For those that type quickly, typing %t1 now has the same effect as 
typing %t 1.
- Fixed a bug that prevented you from purchasing a lore item if you 
have just purchased that item and destroyed it.
- Setting loot split color now changes the text color when others loot 
and autosplit, as well as when the player loots.
- Language skills now update in the skills window immediately, and the 
message given upon skill up includes the name of the language improved.

character out of the game.

they are already stunned.

- Coriante Verisue should no longer talk about Miragul all the time.
- Cobi Frostbeard should no longer refer to himself as "she".

- Corrected a spelling error in Elial Brook's text.
- Frist Furtun now accepts all Upheaval scrolls for his quest.

secondary hand. It is a caster only item.
- Barbed Rubicite Coif has had its name change to Barbed Rubicite 
Pauldrons, since it is a shoulder item, not a head item.
- Kagazz's Box now combines four scorpion legs to create a Box of 
Scorpion Legs.
- Removed Bards and Rogues from the list of classes on Greatstaff of 
the Four Winds, since they could not use the item.
- Sample Chest is no longer No Rent.
- Mushroom Bread now looks like bread in inventory rather than a bowl.
- Corrected the spelling of venomous on a few items.

** Miscellaneous **

- Modified checklist flags to make them a little easier to understand 
(checklist flags are the flags that you obtain for doing PoP events out 
of order that allow you to complete the final flag quest by gathering 
all the checklist flags and talking to a Seer). Now when you receive a 
checklist flag you get a different message than the one that you get 
when you receive a normal flag. Ask the seer to unlock memories and she 
will tell you which checklist flags you have. 
- Corrected a problem that was causing PoP raid flag mobs to not give 
out flags to anyone if the associated boss was killed by someone not in 
the raid group. Now if someone not in a raid gets the kill, only people 
not in a raid can get flagged. This means that people may have to leave 
a raid to get flagged, but it means that raids should no longer miss 
flags if someone outside the raid gets the kill.
- Modified several of the Planes of Power alternate entry quests to 
make completing them faster. Also, all of these quests will now give a 
"key" to everyone in the group of the person that completes it.
- Corrected a spelling error in the text message given when you can no 
longer add unflagged people to your raid ("to" is now "too").
- Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause helmets to seem to disappear 
off a character that was dealing with a merchant or casting an 
illusion.
- /Consent no longer gives both a success and fail message to player 
consented.
- Frogloks wearing robes no longer lose the color on the bottom portion 
of their robes when they zone.
- Fixed some issues with alchemy not combining into dose potions.
- Fixed a bug that could cause invalid and unchangeable numbers to 
appear in spell-casting specialization skills if the skill was trained 
up after level 50.
- Merchants no longer claim that they will pay 1 copper for newbie 
items that they can't actually buy.
- The player's first person perspective now changes correctly if the 
height of their Froglok is changed. 
- Removed an unneeded door in High Keep.

** Tip of the Day ** 

When you first log in you will be presented with a Tip of the Day 
window. We've added this window to provide helpful insight to new 
players, and perhaps a few tips for experienced players as well. 

** Gameplay ** 

- Any character 10th level and under that attempts to attack a 
'red' /con NPC will receive a warning about the danger of such an 
action. 
- Low level characters now memorize and scribe spells much faster. 
- Guards in Steamfont, Misty Thicket, Butcherblock, Nektulos, East 
Freeport and West Freeport should be less likely to run through the 
newbie zone destroying the wildlife 
- Improved the respawn rate for monsters in Steamfont, Misty Thicket, 
Butcherblock, Nektulos, East Freeport and West Freeport. In these zones 
they were respawning less frequently than in all other newbie zones. 
- Added food and bag merchants to the newbie yards of Steamfont, East 
Freeport, West Freeport, Butcherblock and Nektulos. 

** Spells ** 

- Fixed a bug that was causing damage shields to assign the credit for 
their damage to the wrong person. 
- Fixed a bug that caused a short delay in the hit point updates from 
healing spells. 
- Removed Beastlords from the list of classes that can use Strength of 
Stone. They were never intended to get it, as they have a better spell 
of the same type at the same level (Furious strength). 
- Pets will no longer disappear when the pet owner casts a cancel magic 
type spell on the PC that the pet is attacking. 
- Fixed a bug that would allow PC's to be attacked by PC controlled 
pets (in non-PvP situations). 
- Talisman of Alacrity now works on the group and not just the caster. 
It also has the proper icons now. 
- Modified the text messages on many stun spells to prevent some 
confusion with their effect on stun immune mobs. The message has been 
changed from "You have been stunned" to "You are struck by a sudden 
force." 
- Torment of Argli no longer overwrites Torment of Scio. 
- The Lich series no longer conflicts with other DoT effects. This 
affects Dark Pact, Allure of Death, Call of Bones, Lich, Demi Lich, 
Arch Lich, Deathly Temptation, Pact of Hate, Ancient: Master of Death 
and Seduction of Saryrn. 
- The Flame Lick line of spells no longer overwrites hit point buffs 
such as Valor and Skin like diamond. This affects Flame Lick, 
Immolation, Breath of Ro and Immolation of Ro. 
- Changed the name of the druid spell Fury of Ro to Immolation of Ro to 
avoid confusion with the focus effect Fury of Ro. 
- Changed the icon for Kragg's Mending to a heart icon to match other 
Heal spells. 
- Froglok illusion now changes the character's perspective to the 
proper height. 
- Night's Dark Terror has regained its Scarecrow illusion. 
- Added sounds to several spells that were lacking them. 
- The cost of the Fuligan Soulstone of Innoruuk has been cut in half. 

** Zones ** 

- Acrylia Caverns, Hollowshade Moor and Grimling Forest have been 
revamped. We have updated the content in these zones to more accurately 
represent their design intentions and to address concerns voiced by 
players. 
- If you have had an issue with your Plane of Earth B keys, please 
speak with Muzzrap again and he should be able to straighten things 
out. Please make sure that you have the raid group that you want to get 
keyed set up and by your side when you do this. 
- The Trial of Fire event will be much less likely to damage people not 
actually in the trial. 
- We've made a pretty extensive pathing update to the Lake of Ill Omen 
and Beholder, along with several fixes to specific cases in several 
zones. 
- Fixed a bug with the Xegony encounter in Plane of Air. 
- The spires in the Dreadlands are once again sending folks to Luclin. 
- Protectors of Growth now actually protect the Plane of Growth again. 
Beware. 

** The Hollow Acrylia Obelisk ** 

Do not destroy the Hollow Acrylia Obelisk! Due to the revamp of the 
Acrylia Caverns, this key will no longer serve its original purpose. We 
do understand the difficulty of obtaining this key, and we don't want 
to see that effort lost. We will be looking into a way to allow this 
key to retain its value, so don't destroy it. 

** Items ** 

- Items with recommended levels now display any reduced AC component 
value in red. 
- Changed the usable race to Froglok on several of the Shin initiates 
armor quest intermediate pieces. 
- Giant Field Rat whiskers are about twice as common as they were. 
- The Ivory Hilted Cleaver can now be used in the secondary slot (for 
those that can dual-wield). 
- The Ornate Broadsword is no longer listed as usable in the secondary 
slot, since it is Paladin only and can't actually be used there. 
- These items can no longer be worn by Frogloks (they were never 
intended for use by Frogloks): Fright Forged Helm, Mundane Helm, 
Mundane Shield, Mundane Mask, Dread Forged Shield and Terror Forged 
Mask 
- Murph's Minin' Pick no longer lists Clerics as a class that can use 
it, since they could not. 
- Bone Bladed Scimitar no longer lists Beastlords as a class that can 
use it. 
- Cracked Bone Shinguards now have a visible graphic when worn. 
- Sharkbone Plated Shoulderpads effect is now "worn" rather than 
"combat". 
- Stone Etched Mace now displays +135 mana instead of 1135 mana 
- Extended Affliction III now works on spells with a 30 second duration 
(lowered from 36 seconds), so it now functions with Sermon of 
Penitence. 
- Fireworks have casting sounds and Gnomish fireworks will no longer 
cause zones to crash. 
- Compasses once again display the direction you are facing when you 
right-click and hold. 
- The Hammer of Exoneration can now be used by Erudites and Dark Elves. 

** NPCs ** 

- Half-Elf bandits are no longer treated as merchants (so they will now 
leave corpses). 
- A Feral Amalgam is now a plant. 
- Now only one Natasha Whitewaters can exist at a time. 
- Bloodmaw is a little more attentive to his surroundings. 
- Pets no longer attack Tylis Newleaf when he teleports your group. 
- Corrected a bug with AE rampage that caused it to not attack everyone 
it should. 

** Quests ** 

- Fixed the drops for the Comatose spell quest. 
- The Planar Projections for Bertoxxulous and Terris should no longer 
be able spawn in a location where they can't be reached. 
- Fixed several issues with the 8th cudgel quest. 
- Increased the drop rate on some quest items in Hate's Fury. 

** Alternate Advancement Abilities ** 

- Made the Servant of Ro AA pet much more potent. 

** Miscellaneous ** 

- Hit points gained from items are now display with the right value, 
and should help to prevent a few deaths from Cannibalization 
- Bind Wounds no longer uses up a bandage for attempting to use the 
skill when it is not available. 
- Fixed a bug that was not allowing players to link to containers 
unless they linked to something else first. 
- /book with no arguments again closes the spellbook as it should. 

Note: We have also made several spelling and grammar corrections and 
fixed a door here and there.

** Hate Plane **

The new Plane of Hate is now available on all servers!

The Plane of Hate is an old favorite of many players, and we were 
careful to retain as much of its old charm as possible (and all of its 
old quests).  At the same time we created all new geometry for the zone 
using our newer tools and newer design ideas.  Old and new players 
should find this zone to be a lot of fun and a fair challenge.  
Remember, the price for the Fuligan Soulstone of Innoruuk has been cut 
in half.

** Veksar **

Veksar opens on Stormhammer!

Yes, the long-lost ancient city of the Iksar has been discovered.  If 
you're brave enough, foolish enough, and if you can hold your breath, 
you may be the right hero to explore Veksar.  Good luck!

** Changes for New Players **

- Maps for Newbie Zones for all Players - One of the biggest hurdles 
that a new player has to overcome is learning their way around.  For 
those of you that may have started your first character in Neriak, 
youll know what that was like.  In order to help out the new player, 
weve enabled the Map window to make it available to all players if they 
are in a "newbie zone.

- Context Tips - In order to provide helpful information at the time a 
player needs it, we have added several context tips.  These tips will 
pop up when a player uses a certain feature or a specific event occurs.  
We hope this will help our new players to more easily understand the 
gameplay and controls for EverQuest.  These tips may even be useful to 
long time players.  However, if you wish, you can choose to turn off 
any specific tip, or turn off all of the tips using the check boxes in 
the Context Tips window.  

- Improved Help Information - The in game help files have been 
improved.  They now contain much more information.  Hopefully most 
questions you have about the game can be answered using help.

- All New Characters now start with a weapon skill - In order to help 
the new player that might forget to train with their weapon before 
heading out to defeat their first enemy (and even for those of us that 
have been playing a while and still forget to do this), all new 
characters now start off with a skill of 5 in their primary weapon.

- Taunt no longer requires training - Similarly, Taunt now works 
without being trained.  Characters still start out with a skill of 0, 
but the skill can increase with use.

- Packet Loss Meter is now Off by default - Due to the fact that the 
packet loss meter is often confusing to new players, it will be off by 
default.  You can toggle the packet loss meter using the F11 key.

- New Message to prompt new players about the Help button - Weve added 
a chat message that appears when a level 1 through 10 character logs in 
that tells them to click the "?" button on the Window Selection toolbar 
if they need help.

** Spells **

- Divine Intervention Fix - Players have been reporting that Divine 
Intervention was not updating the hit points for the character every 
time when cast, causing characters to die even though the spell seemed 
to have saved them.  We have been unable to reproduce the issue 
specifically, but we have made some changes that should fix the 
problem.  Please use /bug with details of the incident if you continue 
to see this problem.

- Bard Epic Animations - Bards will no longer play instrument 
animations when they have their epic equipped. No more stabbing 
yourselves in the head with your sword instead of playing a flute.

- Healing Messages now include the name of the healer - In order to 
make it clearer who has healed you, we have changed the message that 
you receive when healed.  It will now include the name of the character 
casting the healing spell:  "Bob has healed you for 300 points of 
damage.

- Call of the Hero works in PoW - We have removed the restrictions to 
Call of the Hero in the Plane of Water.  In this particular zone we 
dont believe that the use of this spell needs to be restricted.

- Fear Spell bug fix - Players have reported that when a player 
character was affected by a Fear spell cast by an NPC, they would see 
the character running away but the person affected would not actually 
flee.

- Snare Line bug fix - Fixed an issue that was causing the Snare line 
of spells to fail on an NPC that is under the effects of a Fear spell.

- Tricksters Augmentation group only - We changed Trickster's 
Augmentation to be group only to prevent folks from using it to grief 
other players.

- LD Enchanters no longer cast Mem Blur - Enchanters that go linkdead 
were sometimes casting Memory Blur and similar spells on their enemies.  
This could cause rather unpleasant results for his group or raid when 
the NPC suddenly had a fresh hate list.  Linkdead enchanters will no 
longer cast Memory Blur spells.
 
- Blizzard animation fix - Blizzard was causing a casting animation to 
go off with every wave, even if the caster was sitting.  Now Blizzard 
works like most rain spells, and only triggers a casting animation when 
first cast.

- Locked Spell Gem fix - We fixed a bug that was causing the use of a 
right-click item to refresh the spell gem in the first slot instantly, 
but if that spell had a long recast it would render it useless until 
the spell was forgotten and memorized again.

- Mark of Kings upgrade - In order to make this spell more appealing 
then its lower level counterpart, Mark of Karn, we have: increased the 
duration from 3.5 to 4 minutes, reduced the casting time from 3 to 2 
seconds, reduced the mana cost from 170 to 75 and made the spell 
slightly less resistible.

- Gravel Rain can now be cured - With its very long duration (30 
minutes) it was a bit difficult that this spell could not be removed 
before the duration was over.  This is now a curse and can be cured.

- Summoning a horse in bear form no longer causes you to lose the 
ability to cast spells for a while.

- Rathes Son - The innate ability of the focused version of this pet is 
now less resistible.

- Child of Bertoxxulous - This 65th level Necromancer pet has been 
given a boost.  Its offense has been increased to be in-line with that 
of the Legacy of Zek, and it now has the ability to use a power that is 
essentially the same as the spell Banshee Aura.

- Spirit Call - These pets were running away from enemies when at low 
health. Pets should be far more loyal and willing to risk themselves 
for their Shaman friends, so weve fixed it so that Shaman pets will no 
longer run away.

- Vampiric Embrace - Weve corrected a bug with this spell that would 
prevent the character from casting for a couple of seconds after the 
proc went off.

- Stun Spells - The message on many stun-type spells have been changed 
to more accurately portray their effect on stun immune creatures.

- Mana from Buffs - we have increased the maximum amount of mana that 
can be gained through the use of buff spells.

** Items **

- Zoning and losing your buffs - There has been a long-standing problem 
that could cause all of the buffs to be stripped from a character if 
they zoned with fewer hit points than they had bonus hit points granted 
by items.  For example, if your character had only 10 hit points left 
when zoning, and had an item that granted +15 hit points, all of your 
characters buffs may have been stripped when you completed zoning.  We 
have fixed this bug.  You should now retain your buffs in this 
situation.

- GM Baking Spoon - On Firiona Vie, the Grandmasters Baking Spoon was 
not no-drop.  This allowed players to give out an unlimited number of 
100% weight reduction bags.  This obviously was not the intention for 
that item, so we have made the Grandmasters Baking Spoon no drop on 
Firiona Vie.

- Wooden Medicine Totem - This item can now be equipped.  It couldnt 
before.

- Adjutant Saber - We removed the secondary notation on the item, since 
it was only usable by Shadowknights and Paladins, who couldnt use it in 
their secondary slot anyhow.

- Cloak of the Dar Khura Hero - The effect on this item was listed in 
the database as the wrong effect type.  The effect is now permanent.

** NPCs **

- NPCs returning bags empty - NPCs that return items that they do not 
need were returning all containers empty, regardless of what was inside 
the container. NPCs that refuse unusable items will now also return 
bags with their contents intact.

- NPCs returning multiple items - If a character gave an NPC multiples 
of the same item, the NPC would only give back one of them if he did 
not want them.  We have fixed this so that now those items will be 
returned.  Such items will be stacked on your cursor.  Just click the 
item that is on your cursor into your inventory and the next one will 
appear on your cursor.  Keep clicking them into your inventory until 
you have them all back.  BE WARNED that any of these items that you 
have not returned to your inventory will be lost if you zone or go 
linkdead before you get them back into your inventory.

- The Spirit of Rage - This undead gorilla is now flagged as undead.

- Solusek Ros Guards - These guards will be much more attentive to 
their lord and will aid in his defense.

- NPCs healing too much - We have corrected a bug that was causing some 
NPCs to regain hit points when they turned to run away.  The affected 
NPCs will be of all sorts and in many zones.

- Giant Yellow Jackets - The chance to find a thorax on the corpses of 
these creatures seemed too low, so we have increased it.

** Zones **

- Veeshans Peak - We have changed this zone to make it more appealing, 
particularly for those playing with one or two groups.  We have removed 
the restriction against using gate in this zone and modified the zone 
population.  Over all, the zone will be better to play in.

- Acrylia Caverns - We have fixed an issue with the first two seals 
that was causing the door to the 3rd seal to open without the 3rd seal 
spawning, and without the events being completed correctly.  Now the 
door will only open under proper win conditions, and whenever the door 
opens the 3rd seal should be available.

- Plane of Nightmare - We have changed the logic for entry to the 
Thelin Poxbourne event in Plane of Nightmare. When you talk to Thelin, 
he will now remember your raid and only allow those of the same raid 
into your maze. Only three groups maximum will be allowed through the 
portal into any one maze. If your group is not in a raid, he will allow 
three non-raided groups through into the same maze. If there are three 
non-raided groups in the maze and you try and get a fourth through, he 
will act as any other raid would and tell you that he has already let 
enough people in the maze.

- Planes of Water and Fire - We have changed some of the spells used by 
the mini-bosses in these two zones.  They should be a little easier to 
resist now.

- Halls of Honor - We have removed a recently added summoning ability 
from NPCs. We have introduced a less intrusive method of preventing the 
ability to use area of effect abilities on huge groups of NPCs in the 
zone.

- Bastion of Thunder - The tower bosses will now be dropping some loot 
every time (rather than sometimes not dropping any) like the other 
Planes of Power bosses.

** Quests **

- Added Honey Mush Bread to Cabilis Vendors - This is an item needed 
for a quest that was unavailable.

- Officers Cloak - If you have combined your Officer's Cloak in the 
Security Satchel or you wish to upgrade to the new Officer's Cloak of 
Service, speak with Scout Derrin in Grimling Forest.

-The Skull of Torment quest - This quest, in Kurn's Tower, should now 
work.

** Alternate Advancement **

- Elemental Form - In order to make the Magician Elemental Form 
abilities a bit more useable, weve reduced the reuse time from 72 
minutes to 15 minutes.

- Alternate Advancement timers - We fixed a bug that allowed AA timers 
to be reset early.

- Mass Group Buff - We have made this ability available to Beastlords.

** Miscellaneous **

- Characters getting stuck in the world - We have fixed a bug that 
would cause a character to stay in game for extended periods of time 
after going linkdead.  This bug was causing people to receive a 1018 
error because their character was still in the world and could prevent 
them from logging back in for a long period of time.

- Big Dwarves - Fixed a bug that was causing Dwarves that had their 
size increased twice to start to see the insides of their faces while 
attacking.  This was making even the stoutest Dwarves a bit 
uncomfortable and self-conscious.
 
- Tread water animation fix - We corrected a bug that would 
occasionally cause the treading water animation to stop animating.

** Interface **

- Hit Point percentages display in windows - The Target window, Player 
window and Group window now display hit point percentages.  This is 
something that many player created interfaces use and, considering the 
popularity of this feature, we've decided to add it to the default 
interface.  In the Target and Group windows, the hit point percentages 
will disappear if the appropriate target/groupmate does not exist

- /report - We updated the text message given when you use the /report 
feature to better reflect what text is actually attached to the report.

- More Tips of the Day added - Weve updated the Tips of the Day with 
more tips and cleaned up a few spelling errors with the existing tips.

- Combining Stacks of items - Attempting to combine stacked items in a 
container will no longer work.  The items must be separated first.  
This change will prevent items from being lost due to accidentally 
combining with them stacked.  A dialogue will pop up, warning the 
player to separate the objects.

- Bankers no longer take items - In order to help prevent people from 
losing items by giving them to their banker instead of putting them 
into their bank, players can no longer attempt to trade with bankers.  
A message will tell you to right-click the banker if you wish use your 
bank.

- Guild Management - The Guild Management window will now take your 
setting for "show offline" into account when first displaying the 
window.  The delimiter used in the file created when the "Dump" button 
is pressed has been changed to a [Tab] from a comma, as commas were 
causing confusion when used in the public and private notes.

** Experience System Change - Grouping **

We've made some improvements to the way experience is rewarded in all 
of EverQuest. At its core, the idea is to positively reinforce 
grouping. There should never be any penalty to adding "that sixth 
person over there," whatever class they may be, into your group. That 
is exactly the type of behavior that should be rewarded.

In a massively multi-player game, any mechanic that penalizes those who 
group is one that we need to take a serious look at. While there are 
definite benefits to forming "well balanced" groups in terms of damage, 
tanking, healing, and support, there shouldn't be an active penalty to 
those who cannot find groups of "optimal" balance.

As it stands in EverQuest, groups gain a 2% to 20% experience bonus, 
which we refer to as the "group bonus", for having two to six members. 
In practice, however, this has never been much of a bonus, even in the 
case of a full group, given that the experience was already being 
divided six ways.

In the past, we had also attempted to reward people for adventuring in 
the more challenging Planes of Power zones by making those zones give a 
better rate of experience.

As of this update, groups now gain 20% to 80% "group bonus" experience 
for having two to five members. 

Full, six-person, groups now see an additional bonus. Their experience 
is only divided five ways, yet they still gain the 80% "group bonus." 
For those who think in terms of pie charts, it amounts to a larger 
piece of a larger pie.

Accordingly, the bonus inherent to Planes of Power zones will be 
decreased slightly. However, as long as person is grouped with at least 
one other, they will see an improvement in experience gain over the old 
system. The one down side to the new system is that there will be a 
slight decrease in experience for those who do not group, and only for 
those who do so in Planes of Power zones.

We realize that we are, essentially, "manufacturing" a new type of 
experience after a kill. As players, we also understand it is the 
people who spend time in full groups who have to deal with the most 
interruptions and setup time caused by organizing the extra people. It 
simply makes sense to reward that extra time, especially if it means 
bringing more people together. After all, that's the whole point.

We look forward to seeing how these changes play out on Test Server.

** Experience System Change - Level 60+ **

In addition to the above changes, we have increased the range of NPC 
levels that give a person experience after they reach level 60. The 
"blue to 65" range has been increased as far as level 50, with the 
"light blue" range extending to level 45. The best benefits, however, 
are still for fighting things around and above your level. 

The world of EverQuest, at this point in its history, is truly immense 
and full of the best and most interesting content and visuals out 
there. Ideally, when a person logs on they should have a wide array of 
places in which to adventure. The addition of new content shouldn't 
entirely obsolete what already exists. Hopefully these changes will 
once again make that the case.

** Experience System Change - Grouping **

We've made some improvements to the way experience is rewarded in EverQuest. 
These improvements are aimed at positively reinforcing the 
act of grouping. After all, this is a Massively Multiplayer game.

Prior to this update groups gained a 2% to 20% experience bonus for 
having two to six members.

As of today this bonus has increased to range from 20% to 80% for 
having two to five members. When a group adds a sixth member, the 80% 
bonus remains, but the experience gained is only divided by 5 before 
being distributed. The sixth group member no longer causes the 
experience gain to be divided by 6.

Planes of Power zones had an increased experience award above and 
beyond those of most other zones. Because of these new dramatic 
improvements to group experience gains, we will be reducing the zone-
specific experience bonus for Planes of Power zones a bit. As long as 
character is grouped with at least one other in these zones, they will 
see an improvement in experience gain over the old system. The one down 
side to the new system is that there will be a small decrease in 
experience for those who do not group, and only for those who do so in 
Planes of Power zones.

** Experience System Change - Level 60+ **

In addition to the above changes, we have increased the range of NPC 
levels that give a character experience after they reach level 60. This 
will open up many of the "old world" zones to players previously 
restricted to Planes of Power zones for experience gain. The range of 
NPCs that will be "blue" to a level 65 character has been increased as 
far as level 50, with the "light blue" range extending to level 45. The 
best experience gains, however, are still for fighting things around 
and above your level. This should open up areas for high level 
characters in groups and solo.

** Interface **

- Shared Bank Vault - We've added two shared bank slots to the 
interface. These extra bank slots can be accessed by any character on 
the same account and server. No-Drop and No Rent items can't be placed 
in these bank slots, and only one of any specific Lore item can exist 
in the shared bank at any time.

- Spell Context Menus - This is a new interface menu that will make 
memorizing spells less tedious. To access the spell menu, just right-
click an empty spell gem. This will open a list of spell categories. 
Point your mouse at a category and a list of spells will be displayed. 
Select a spell from that list to memorize it in that slot. Your 
character will sit down, memorize the spell and stand back up.

- Spell Favorites - Spell favorites are an easy way to memorize a full 
set of eight spells without the tedious book searching. Right-clicking 
on the spellbook icon in your spell window will open up the spell 
favorites menu. You will be able to save your current spell lineup as a 
favorite, delete a favorite or memorize all the spells in one of your 
already saved spell sets. You can save as many as ten sets of spell 
favorites. As with the new spell context menus mentioned above, this 
will not replace the spellbook, it is meant to make memorizing large 
numbers of spells more convenient.

- Spell Descriptions - We have expanded the spell description window. 
Along with the information that has always been available, we have 
added an explanation about what the spell does in general that includes 
damage and duration when appropriate. You can see these new 
descriptions by right-clicking and holding on the spell scroll, the 
spell gem in your Spells window, or the spell icon in your spellbook.

- New Camera - We've added a new camera mode to the game. Lovingly 
dubbed the EQ Cam, it uses the mouse wheel to allow you to zoom away 
from your character into a "chase" camera. This only works from first 
person mode (the default view). Using the mouse wheel you can determine 
the distance of the camera from your character, or to zoom back into 
first person mode. When in the chase mode, mouselook turns the 
character and camera together and you can change the pitch of the 
camera using the mouse.

- NPC Names - Many NPCs will be displaying additional titles to make it 
clearer what their job is. For example, an NPC that sells tailoring 
supplies may have the title [Tailor Supplies] under their name. This 
will help folks find the proper merchant. It's analogous to them 
hanging out their shingle.

- Rare Character Select Crash - Using the arrow keys to try to change 
the selected character at the character select screen when there were 
no characters on the account was causing people to crash out of the 
game. That's fixed now.

- Guild Message of the Day - Using certain HTML codes when setting up a 
Guild Message of the Day was causing all members of the guild to crash. 
While this may have been amusing for pranks on your guild, we still 
decided to fix it.

** Spells **

- Spell level limits now enforced - Some high level spells cannot be 
cast on characters under a certain level. In the past a caster could 
get around this level restriction when casting a group version of a 
spell by targeting a higher level group member, and the spell would 
take effect on the whole group, regardless of their level. That 
loophole has been closed. We're sorry if you have grown accustomed to 
the system working this way, but those level restrictions are important 
to the integrity of lower level gameplay.

- Incineration and Conglaciation of Bones - Both of these spells should 
now crit and stack (when cast by different casters).

- Divine Intervention - This spell should now be reporting the amount 
of healing it delivers.

- Healing Messages - The target of a healing spell will now get a 
message telling them the caster's name and the amount of healing they 
receive.

- Reporting Damage Over Time - Damage over Time (DoT) done to NPCs will 
now be reported to the caster every time it does damage. These messages 
can be filtered in the Options window.

- Boon of the Garou - The level restriction for this spell has been 
removed. We have also fixed a bug with the spell that would prevent it 
from being cast on target that are not on a horse if the enchanter is 
on horseback (spell still cannot affect those on horseback).

- Wake of Karana - To improve the usefulness of this spell, we have 
lowered the recast time from 90 seconds to 15 seconds.

- Beastlord Warders - Beastlords will once again be able to summon 
their warders in the Plane of Sky. Sorry for the delay in getting this 
one fixed properly.

- Familiars - Familiars will no longer attempt to equip items. This was 
causing them to try to wear weapons inside their heads, which probably 
isn't a good thing for them to do.

- Spirit spell line - We have added +75 dexterity to the effects of 
Spirit of Flame, Spirit of Rellic, and Spirit of Snow.

- Spell stacking and blocking - Changed the following spell lines to 
cause them to bounce off of each other. Each line should block 
everything from the other line, but still be overwritten by spells of 
the same line.

Spiritual Strength
Spiritual Brawn
Spiritual Vigor

Strength of Tunare
Strength of Nature

Brell's Mountainous Barrier
Brell's Stalwart Shield
Brell's Steadfast Aegis

- Translocation spells - Fixed a bug with translocation spells. If a 
second translocation spell was cast on a character before he had 
accepted the first, both would fail.

- Spell casting pets - In the past, pets were restricted to casting 
spells of level 20 and below. We have given them access to higher level 
spells. You may want to be careful with them until you get used to 
their new abilities. 

- Drunken Riders - We fixed an odd bug that allowed people who were 
extremely drunk to cast spells without mana cost while on a horse. Yes, 
crazy bugs like that actually happen. :)

** Zones **

- Droga and Nurga - The mines of Nurga have been inhabited by crafty 
Goblins and stolid Burynai for many long years, digging and slaving 
away under the earth. It's time to shake them up! The redesign for 
these zones are now on the Legends server, Stormhammer. The mines of 
Nurga are a fun zone for characters of levels about 40 to 55. The 
Temple of Droga accommodates characters around 50th to 65th level. Both 
zones will have some new events and quest, while retaining the distinct 
feel of the zones.

- Veksar - Since the rediscovery of the lands of Kunark, there have 
been rumors springing from the ancient lore of the Iksar. Most of those 
rumors remain unfounded, as gaining access to the lore of the insular 
Iksar is no easy task. One of the most persistent legends is about a 
city that lies buried under the Lake of Ill Omen. That city was called 
Veksar, and it is up to you to discover the tale of its fate.

- Planes of Power access - Planes of Power has provided us with 
valuable insight into the group and guild dynamics that are involved in 
large scale games. The way that we had expected guilds to advance 
through the story of Planes of Power has become a problem for some 
guilds as some members have fallen behind and found it difficult to 
catch up. Obviously this was not our intention. We want people to play 
with their friends and guild mates.

To correct this issue, we will be allowing characters to enter the 
following Planes of Power zones by meeting a simple level requirement:

Level 55 and over
Plane of Storms
Plane of Torment
Plane of Valor
Crypt of Decay

Level 62 and over
Bastion of Thunder
Halls of Honor

Characters that don't meet the level requirement may still enter these 
zones using the existing flags, and raids may still bring additional 
unflagged or lower level characters with them. All other planes with 
flag or story requirements for entry will still require those flags, 
and those flags can still be obtained as they always have.

This will make the majority of Planes of Power zones available to 
characters over the minimum level, and will allow their guilds to 
travel and adventure together in the planes. We understand that those 
that have already earned the entry flags for these zones have put some 
effort into that accomplishment. We will be giving a reward to those 
that have done so, though you'll have to wait to see what that reward 
is.

If you have completed the requirements for flags for these zones, you 
may wish to visit Gram Dunnar. Part of the reward for gaining entry 
flags is in the form of experience. 

+++ Before speaking to Gram Dunnar, be sure you have your experience 
distribution set as you'd like it between standard and alternate advancement experience. +++

- Great Divide - The Plane of Knowledge portal in the Great Divide will 
now be available when the Ring War is in progress.

- Bastion of Thunder - We have upgraded the loot available from many of 
the mini-bosses in the Bastion of Thunder to make the reward more 
inline with the risk.

- Sol Ro's Tower - They look like frogs, hop like frogs and now they 
even react to spells like frogs. Flame Frogs are now flagged as 
animals.

- Rallos Zek encounter - Rallos Zek will remove anyone from the zone 
that attacks him if they are not part of the raid that has him engaged. 
Even in war, there are rules to be followed.

** Items **

- Tradeskill item flag - There is a new flag on items. When viewing the 
information about an item, if you see that it has a Tradeskill flag, it 
is an item that can be used in a tradeskill recipe. This isn't to 
clearly spell out every item that is used in every tradeskill recipe. 
The intent is to assist those who are finding items that do not already 
have an obvious use, by letting them know that the item is used in a 
tradeskill recipe, somewhere.

- LoY "Fine Steel" - Many of the more commonly dropped weapons in the 
Legacy of Ykesha zones were a bit too powerful for the ease and level 
needed to get them. Some of the most out of line items were the 
Harpoon, Luggald Trident, and Luggald Dagger. We've decided that it is 
necessary to tune them down a bit.

- The Hollow Acrylia Obelisk - This is the old Acrylia key. It has been 
changed into a charm. This charm can be used by anyone, not just those 
that own LoY.

- Bows - The Longbow of the Grimlings and the Bow of Gloaming have both 
been given ranges. They can now be used properly.

- The Burning Flame Shield - This item had the wrong resist modifiers. 
It now has a +30 fire resistance and a -10 cold resistance.

- Bazaar Search - Non-instrument items with instrument modifiers will 
now show up in instrument type searches in the Bazaar.

- Ornate Stone Medicine Totem - This item can now be equipped.

- Storm Reaper Thorn Machete - This newbie Halfling quest weapon is now 
flagged as magical.

- Charm of the Brotherhood - This item will now give a bonus when 
grouped with others of either the same class or race.

- Dagger of Distraction - This item can no longer be used by Monks.

- Edge of Eternity - Beastlords and monks can no longer use this item.

- Veil of Lost Hopes and Orb of Clinging Death - The casting times on 
both of these items has been lowered.

- Magi`Kot's Pants of Convergence - The effect on this item has been 
changed to summon a Rod of Mystical Transvergance.

- Cloak of the Falling Skies - The focus effect this item has changed 
to Preservation of Solusek

- The Wristguard of Keen Vision - This item is now useable by int. 
casters.

- The Mask of Conceptual Energy - This item is now useable by priests.

** Alternate Advancement **

- Lifeburn - This ability would cause an undue amount of aggro to be 
generated because it would bring the caster to an extremely low number 
of hit points, making them look like tasty targets to enemies nearby. 
To lessen this problem, Lifeburn will no longer reduce the caster to 10 
hit points, but to about one fourth of the caster's hit points. This 
should prevent the additional agro generated while retaining the risk 
for using the ability.

- Feigned Minion - The Child of Bertoxxulous pet will no longer cast 
buff spells to break his feign when under the Feigned Minion effect.

** Quests and Tradeskills **

- Bankers - There were a few quests that required giving an item to a 
banker. When we recently removed the ability for characters to give 
items to bankers to help prevent mistakenly losing items, those quests 
became unavailable. We have moved those quests to new NPCs. If you see 
any other quests that ask you to give something to a banker, please use 
/bug and report it to us.

- Newly Stackable Items - Valor Crystals, Ceramic Linings, Holgresh Fur 
and Casks are now stackable. Also, Valor Crystals can be sold to 
vendors. 

- Sewer Catfish - These unappetizing fish have begun to appear in 
Cabilis.

- Klok Foob - Will now accept a Catfish Croak Sandwich.

** Changes for New Characters **

- Newbie Starting Locations - We've modified all locations where new 
characters start to make them a bit more convenient for the new player. 
They should all start very near their guild masters.

- Nudging - New characters will be given a text message to encourage 
them to hand in their newbie note to their guild master. For new 
players, this is one of the key things to get them involved in 
gameplay, and one of the easiest to overlook.

- Guild Masters - To help guide new characters, Guild Masters now take 
a more active role in helping out new recruits by directing them to 
some starting points for quests.

- Quests - There are even more quests in the newbie zones, most of them 
revolving around the pests that seem to inhabit even the grandest 
cities.

** Miscellaneous **

- We are working on an update to the Luclin player character model 
animations. This will not be a complete revamp of all the animations, 
but will address some of the most common concerns. However, in the mean 
time you may see some unusual animations, particularly when shorter PCs 
are running.

** UI File Changes **

NOTE: In order to see the new Shared Bank slots, you will need to use 
the default bank window, or modify your custom bank window to include 
the new slots.

Noted Later: The reward for planar progression has been added. If you 
have completed the requirements for flags for the newly opened Planes 
of Power zones, you may wish to visit Gram Dunnar in the Plane of 
Knowledge.

June 12, 2002  News Story: Prexus Server Crashes Entirely
------------------------------

Last night at about 1:00 in the morning Prexus had a severe breakdown. 
Our Operations team has been working to get it restored and back into 
service. Our hope is that we'll have it back up and running some time 
this evening. 

That's the bad news. The worse news is that we will have to recreate 
all of the characters on the server from backups that are perhaps more 
than 24 hours old. Anything those characters have earned in the last 
day or so will be lost. Unfortunately, we will not be able to restore 
items or experience lost to the roll back. 

There is some potential good news, though. If you have deleted a 
character in the last year or so, that character may return. So if you 
see a character that you deleted a few months ago on your character 
select screen, that's why. 

Important Note: The restoration of these characters may leave you with more 
than eight characters on Prexus. In cases like this, the character 
select screen will list your characters in alphabetical order, and only 
show you the first eight of those characters. This may make some of 
your characters appear to be missing. They are not missing. All you 
need to do is delete one or more of the visible characters in order to 
see the ones that are not shown. 

We are extremely sorry that this has happened. We are doing everything 
we can to restore the server.

We have updated the Run, Walk and Turn animations for the Luclin 
models. As you can tell, new animations require a lot of data. We're 
sorry for the size of the update, but we think you'll like the changes. 

Thank you.

June 24, 2003
------------------------------

Stability - we have made some changes that should increase server 
stability. 

Pathing issues - Corrected some issues with pathing that were causing 
warping in the Halls of Honor and allowing NPCs to teleport to places 
that they shouldn't have (in Highkeep, for example). Also, creatures 
should no longer spin after returning to their spawn points (this was 
most noticeable with dragons and wurms).

** Information Gathering ** 

You will soon notice a new dialogue box appear when you log in (it 
appears after logging in three times to prevent spam for new players). 
We are asking you to let us gather a bit of information about your 
computer that will help us build the future of EverQuest. 

The important thing here is that you can say no and we won't gather any 
information. 

If you do accept, we'll gather CPU, RAM and video card information to 
help us evaluate and improve EverQuest. If you agree and then change 
your mind later, you can disable the feature under the Options tab 
(Alt-O) and then the General tab in game. 

So when you see the new dialogue box appear, please read it over 
carefully and click whichever answer you feel most comfortable with. 

Thanks. 

** Zones ** 

- Droga and Nurga moving to Live servers - These zones were revamped 
and sent to Legends, and now they are moving to the Live servers. This 
is a great chance to revisit these zones. 

- Chardok - Treachery and lies are not uncommon in the court of the 
Overking. But there are some unusual rumors being told by some unusual 
adventurers. Some say that there is strife within the council of the 
Overking, and that heroes may find adventure there while that strife 
lasts. OOC: We're introducing a new zone and a new zone type. The Halls 
of Betrayal is a "pocket zone", and new type of zone for EverQuest. It 
will exist for a short time to be part of the storyline, and then will 
be gone. So if you're going to see it, now is the time. 

- Grieg's End revamp going to Legends - The redesign includes new 
encounters, items, traps, and events that make the zone a challenge for 
the experience group, with plenty of events for a raid group. 

- Plane of Earth B - we have removed the Call of the Hero restrictions 
in this zone. 

- Rallos Zek - the Warlord will now kick anyone out of the zone that is 
on his hate list and is not in a valid raid greater then 20 people in 
size. This should prevent single players being able to attack him and 
grief other players who are making a valid attempt at him. This is in 
addition to the previous limitations of having only one raid allowed to 
attack him at any given time. 

- Increased Experience - We have increased the experience modifier in 
the Tower of Solusek Ro, Halls of Honor, The Temple of Marr, and the 
Lair of Terris Thule. 

- Bastion of Thunder - The mini-bosses in Bastion of Thunder no longer 
spawn immediately after the zone comes up. 

** Tradeskills ** 

- Tradeskill chance of failures changed - The higher your skill is over 
the trivial of the combine, the less likely you are to fail with a 
combine. This is a reduction on the chance to always fail. 

- Stackable - Ice Burrower Silk, Pie Tins and Muffin Tins are now 
stackable. 

** Spells ** 

- New Imbue, Enchant, and Thicken spells - New Imbue, Enchant, and 
Thicken spells have been added that create five magical items rather 
than just one. These spells require five components and take longer to 
cast and use more mana. 

- Damage Over Time Spell Foci - Extended Affliction has been changed to 
Burning Affliction, which causes DoT spells to do more damage instead 
of having a longer duration. 

- Enthrall spells - Enthrall spells will not un-stun the target when 
they wear off if there are other enthrall spells on that target. Also, 
when an enthrall spell breaks due to damage it will now remove all 
Enthrall spells, not just the first one it finds. 

- Ferocity - We have removed the component requirement for Ferocity. 

- Kindle - We have added a new Magician spell to the game called 
Kindle. 

- Force of Akera - We have added a new Paladin spell to the game called 
Force of Akera. 

- Burnout V - this spell should now stack with the Shielding line of 
spells. 

- New Spell levels for Clarity line - Boon of the Clear Mind is now a 
level 44 spell, Clarity II is now a level 52 spell and Gift of Pure 
Thought is now level 56. 

- Area of Effect spells - AoE spells that do not affect your group in 
PvP no longer affect your Raid in PvP either. 

- Direct Damage spell messages - Striking the killing blow with a 
direct damage spell will no longer show a double cast on the spell 
message. 

- Target Group Buff - TGB will no longer work with any illusions. 

- Illusion - With Permanent Illusion, Levitation effects will no longer 
be stripped when zoning and gnome enchanters with a large-size illusion 
will no longer return to gnome size after zoning. In general, 
characters that are under the effect of a size-changing illusion should 
be seen properly by everyone. 

- Song Spam - Bards should see less spam when they hit low level PCs 
with their high level songs. 

- Treeform - This spell should now work in Luclin outdoor zones. 

- Draught of Lightning - We have added a new Wizard spell to the game 
called Draught of Lightning. 

** Items ** 

- Bards Using Components - Bards using right-click items with a casting 
time greater than 0 will now expend any required components. 

- Ornate Armor Molds - These molds are more readily available. 

- Spellshield - Spellshield items now reduces spell damage by a 
percentage rather than a fixed amount. 

- Strikethrough and Stun Resist - You will now receive a message when 
Strikethrough and Stun Resist work. 

** Quests ** 

- Newbie Quests - Erudites, Trolls, Ogres and Barbarians now have 
quests in their newbie areas similar to those implemented for all other 
races. This completes the updated newbie quests for all races. 

- Seana and Stefan Marsinger - These two will be clearer when giving 
their quest requests, and will return them if you hand them to the 
wrong Marsinger. 

- Bors Wharhammer - He will be checking level instead of flags as a 
requirement for his quests to bring him in-line with the flag removals 
for the lower tier planes. 

** Alternate Advancement ** 

- Frenzied Burnout - this ability has been changed to better stack with 
the Burnout spells. The attack speed portion of the spell has been 
reduced in percentage (it hastes the pet much less), but changed to a 
"bard" haste which will stack with Burnout V. The strength bonus has 
also been decreased but made to stack with that of Burnout V. 

** Skills ** 

- Sneak - Sneak will now work under water. 

- Instill Doubt - Instill Doubt will now work if the Monk is using his 
other skills. Previously, use of other skills such as a kick would 
cause Instill Doubt to fail. 

** Interface ** 

- Camera - We have added the ability to bind cameras to keys. This will 
allow players to hit one key to switch to a desired camera rather than 
having to cycle through the F9 camera chain. This can be changed in the 
Options window (Alt-O) under the Keyboard tab (select "camera" from the 
list). 

- Auto-inventory - Items right-clicked off your corpse will now be 
place into your inventory in the correct order. 

- Spell Favorites - Creating a spell favorite name that matches a name 
that already exists will cause the new favorite to be saved over the 
old (whereas before it would create a second list with the same name). 

- Random name generator - Asking for a name should no longer result in 
a name that will be rejected due to duplication. Note: names can still 
be rejected by GM's. 

- Bow Graphics - Bows that have been autoequipped will now display a 
graphic. 

- Raids - The creation of a group will now work from inside a raid. 

- New Filters - We've added a Melee Warnings filter. It will filter out 
"cannot see your target" and "cannot hit them from here" messages, 
along with other such melee warnings. 

- Spell category lists - We moved a few of the Necromancer spells 
around on the category lists (from right-clicking spell gems) to make 
more sense. 

** Miscellaneous ** 

- Updated character creation descriptions - Right-clicking the class, 
race or statistic buttons while in the character creation screen will 
display a detailed explanation of the item clicked. 

- Clicking on corpses - Right-clicking on a PC corpse other than your 
own will no longer make a character visible. 

- Mounts - Fixed a bug with mounts showing up with incorrect Luclin 
model settings. Mounts should now only show up when the Luclin models 
for the character race of the rider AND mounts/elementals are both on. 

Also, as a heads up to players that have created their own user 
interfaces for EverQuest, these are the interface files that we have 
changed:

August 6, 2003  3:00 am

Note: Some internal data restructuring created a delay in the 
introduction of the new platinum slot in the shared bank and the new 
text filters. We will bring those to the Live servers as soon as we 
can. 

** New Adventure in Lavastorm! ** 

In the depths of the Lavastorm Mountains there is only one ruler. But 
even his burning breath and power have their limits. Rumor has it that 
there is wealth and danger in locations even further below the boiling 
lands than Lord Nagafen can reach. These tales have been spreading like 
ripples on a calm lake, and their point of origin appears to be an 
upstart barbarian named Morden. Some say that he's already delved these 
fabled caverns and taken what there was of value. Other say that he 
couldn't have carried it all off by himself. But most say that he's a 
rogue, a teller of tales, and not to be trusted. Will you discover the 
truth and brave the heat, or will you sit beside your cozy campfire and 
listen to stories? 

This new adventure zone will only be around for a while, so you may 
want to visit soon. 

** Spells ** 

- Summoned Burning Affliction focus items added - Mages have four new 
spells, Summon Wooden Bracelet, Summon Stone Bracelet, Summon Iron 
Bracelet, and Summon Steel Bracelet. The bracelets summoned provide the 
Burning Affliction effect for DoT spells. 
- Summoned container spells updated - The Quiver of Marr, Bandoleer of 
Luclin and the Pouch of Quellious now appear filled with the 
appropriate item (for example, the Quiver of Marr now appears with six 
stacks of arrows). Also, these items should all be exactly the same, so 
the quiver function should work properly. 
- Mass Enchant spells corrected - The mass enchant spells for 
Adamantite, Brellium, Mithril and Steel now create the 5 enchanted 
blocks that they should. 
- Illusion: Guktan is available - This is an illusion spell for the new 
Froglok models. 
- Illusion: Scaled Wolf is available - This is an illusion spell for 
the Scaled Wolf seen in Kunark. 
- Tiny Companion - The spell scroll for this spell is no longer No 
Drop. 
- Dooming Darkness no longer overwrites Cascading Darkness. 

** Items ** 

- Moss Covered Hood - This item can now be equipped by all classes. 
- Silk String - This item is now stackable. 

** Trade Skills ** 

- New Fletching recipes added - We've added several new Karana-only 
fletching recipes to help round out that skill. 

** Quests and Zones ** 

- Halls of Betrayal - Corrected an error with some of the quest item 
drops in this zone. 
- Plane of Time - The events in Plane of Time B now remember the 
progress your raid has made through the zone when you leave and will 
restore you to the same state when you return. 
- Kagazz will respond when you ask him about fasteners. 
- Experience in city zones updated - Some time around the release of 
Planes of Power we reduced the experience gain in some city zones. The 
experience gained from quests in those zone has been increased. 
- Ogre newbie quests - Added a weapon quest for young ogres. 
- Iksar Necromancer Spell Vendors - The Iksar necromancer spell vendors 
have moved and are a lot closer to the necromancer guild. This should 
make it easier for new necromancers to find these vendors and will 
hopefully boost their sales. 

** Miscellaneous ** 

- Spell book bug - Corrected a bug that was causing characters to be 
randomly forced to stand up when in their spell book. 
- Client crash information - If your game crashes on the client side, a 
dialogue box will come up asking if you'd like to send us the

** Lost Dungeons of Norrath Adventures ** 

The Lost Dungeons of Norrath is our largest expansion to-date, 
featuring the most content ever delivered in an EverQuest expansion. 
The Lost Dungeons expansion features 48 new dungeons that span the old 
world of Norrath, focusing on several long lost locations, including 
the Rujarkian Hills and Deepest Guk. Encounter never before seen 
monsters that prowl the halls of these dungeons, waiting to challenge 
any explorer brave enough to venture in. 

In this expansion, players are introduced to several exciting new 
concepts in adventuring through the world of EverQuest. After joining 
the Wayfarers Brotherhood, you and your group undertake perilous new 
adventures into the recently unearthed Lost Dungeons of Norrath. These 
new adventures offer many benefits, including a clearly defined goal, 
the ability to play and make progress in a couple hours per adventure, 
and the confidence that you can set a time to meet your friends and 
have a dungeon fully available for you right away - no competition and 
no waiting! 

Additionally, one of the most important gameplay improvements we've 
made in Lost Dungeons of Norrath is the introduction of personalized 
dungeon adventures for single groups. When you and your group receive 
an adventure, you're provided with a full dungeon exclusively for your 
own use. There's no need to worry that you're competing against others 
to reach the same goal, or that someone might already be camping there. 
All the focus is on having fun, which allows you to get lost in the 
adventuring and fighting to accomplish your objective. The challenge is 
the dungeons themselves - if you can best the Lost Dungeons, you 
deserve the rewards. 

Lost Dungeons of Norrath breaks the mold of traditional zones by 
allowing every zone in the expansion to provide adventures for all 
groups between levels 20 and 65. Each time you embark on a new 
adventure, you're sent to one of 48 distinct dungeon zones, each 
customized with challenging monsters and traps tailored to the level of 
your group. This means, as long as you're over level 20, you'll have 48 
challenging new dungeons to explore and conquer! 

Beyond the hundreds of single-group adventures in the Lost Dungeons 
expansion, you can also join up to 36 of your friends for powerful raid 
encounters! Take part in several new raids that you can do on your own 
schedule, with no competition or racing against other guilds. Set up 
raiding times that are convenient for you and your friends, with the 
knowledge that the dungeon will be there waiting for you when you log 
in! 

The Lost Dungeons of Norrath expansion will redefine EverQuest by 
providing an enormous amount of adventuring possibilities, with the 
addition of massive amounts of content to the game - far more than any 
previous expansion.

screen, or at https://store.station.sony.com!

** Lost Dungeons of Norrath Downloads ** 

If you ever plan on ordering or buying Lost Dungeons, we recommend 
starting the downloads now. 

You can start downloading files *before* you make any decision to pre-
order the expansion! 

We have been introducing the LDoN files in small bits for several days 
now. This is the most convenient way for you to get the files you'll 
need for the new expansion. 

Whether you plan on ordering the expansion online, or buying it in the 
store, or are even thinking that you might buy it sometime later on, 
you'll have a much easier time if you get the downloading out of the 
way in our daily LDoN pre-downloads. 

As with all expansion releases, the downloaders will likely be very 
busy on the first day. Even if you buy the CD, you'll still need to 
wait through a small download on launch day. 

We recommend beating the launch-day rush and downloading as much as you 
can, as early as you can. It will get you online and into the game that 
much faster. 

The easiest way to begin downloading the files is to click yes when the 
dialogue box pops up asking you if you'd like to incrementally download 
LDoN. 

If you've already told that dialogue never to appear again, you can get 
the files in a few easy steps: 

- Run EverQuest from your Start menu or Desktop shortcut as normal. 
- Click the Advanced button 
- Click the checkbox next to Lost Dungeons of Norrath 
- Click Save 
- Click Download 

This will catch you up on the downloads you have missed, and will 
update you as we continue to add files. This will make your download 
much smaller the day LDoN launches, or the day you purchase the digital 
version of the expansion.

** Zone Revamps ** 

- The Deep, Charasis (Howling Stones), Dragon Necropolis, Siren's 
Grotto, The Hole, The City of Mist, and The Accursed Temple of Cazic-
Thule have been partially revamped. Gameplay in these zones has been 
improved, based on feedback from players and careful review of the 
content. The changes are not dramatic, but make these zones more 
entertaining to play in. 

- The Plane of Mischief, home of the trickster Bristlebane, has 
undergone an extensive revamp. As one of the most unusual places to 
visit in EverQuest, this zone is a very interesting challenge, if you 
have a sturdy funny bone. The improved zone is now available on 
Stormhammer. 

- The Greig's End revamp is now available on the Live servers. The 
redesign includes new encounters, items, traps, and events that make 
the zone a challenge for the experience group, with plenty of events 
for a raid group. 

** Interface ** 

- /memspellset # - Using this command memorizes one of your saved spell 
sets. # is the number or name (or shortened name) of the spell set you 
wish to memorize. Note that if you use a shortened version of the spell 
set name, it will match the first spell set that has those characters, 
so /memspellset Dots will find your "Dots and Charms", or "Dots", or 
"Dotsandstuff" - whichever shows up first on your list. 

- A Platinum slot has been added to the shared bank to make 
transactions between characters on the same account more convenient. 

- Clip Plane - The clip plane slider should work more reliably now. 
Where before it may not have done anything until lowered to a very low 
percentage, now the slider should have an effect at any setting. 

- Filters for your own pet's messages have been added. Your own pet's 
attacks are no longer subject to the Other Attacks/Misses filters. On 
the options screen there is now a separate button for filtering YOUR 
Pet attack messages. Also, the ability to redirect your pet attack 
messages to any chat window has been added to the chat window context 
menus. 

- /random messages can now be sent to any chat window you'd like. There 
is no option to filter these messages, however, to prevent any loss of 
the information in cases where it is needed (meaning, people can't 
claim that they didn't see the /random that they lost just to force a 
re-roll). 

- The Journal Window has been changed to make it easier to use and 
understand. We've merged the the two information windows into a single 
window. 

- Fixed a bug in the Looking for Group window. The Get Matches button 
should no longer grey out at inappropriate times. 

- The Bad Word Filter now filters chat channel text as well as other 
game text. 

- To make things a little more logical, the /inspect command will allow 
characters to inspect interactive objects for LDoN, and /toggleinspect 
allows you to toggle on or off the ability to inspect other player 
characters using the mouse. 

** Alternate Advancement ** 

- Purify Soul reuse time reduced from 72 minutes to 30 minutes. 

- Divine Resurrection reuse time reduced from 36 hours to 18 hours. 

- Celestial Regeneration reuse timer reduced from 72 minutes to 15 
minutes. We have increased the duration from 24 seconds to 48 seconds, 
adjusted the amount healed, and made this a group effect. 

- Celestial Renewal duration increased from 24 seconds to 48 seconds, 
adjusted the amount healed, and this has become a group effect. 

- Harmtouch has been fixed. There was a problem with the timer for 
Harmtouch that would make it appear to reset when the character was 
logged out, even though it does not reset until the appropriate amount 
of time has passed. 

- Summon Death Charger and Summon Holy Steed have been fixed. We fixed 
a bug that caused these abilities to fail until the character zoned or 
logged out. 

- Endless Quiver no longer grants an endless supply of thrown weapons, 
only arrows. 

** Spells ** 

- Unswerving Hammer of Faith has had its mana cost reduced from 250 to 
175. 

- Divine Barrier no longer has a damage shield component and has gained 
three times the healing effect. 

- Celestial Remedy has had its mana cost lowered from 190 to 150. 

- A targeting issue with pets is now fixed. There was a bug that caused 
pets to be untargetable with the F1 key and with pet spells that target 
the pet automatically. This was happening only if a pet was summoned 
and then a mount was summoned. 

- AE Rain Spells were resisted 100% of the time when an NPC was above 
level 20 and had less than 10% of its hit points left. This will no 
longer happen. 

- Eye of Zomm would cause a player's pet to kill itself if that pet was 
commanded to kill the owner's Eye. This has been corrected. Also, the 
Eye no longer moves at incredible speed under water, but they can now 
swim up and down in water. 

- PBAoE Songs no longer prevent a bard from singing if used while the 
bard has himself targeted. 

- Illusions can once again be cast on others while the caster is on a 
mount. 

- When Invisibility drops due to looting a corpse, the player will be 
informed that their invisibility has dropped. 

- Pets no longer break enthrall. 

- Armor of the Zealot will no longer be overwritten by Focus of Soul 
and Focus of the Seventh. Blessed Armor of the Risen and Ancient: High 
Priest's Bulwark will no longer be overwritten by Focus of Spirit or 
Khura's Focusing. Also, Pact of Hate and Call of Darkness should stack 
properly (meaning that they won't stack). 

- Illusion: Guktan was fixed on all servers a little while ago. We just 
wanted you to be aware that the spell will make the target look like a 
Guktan, not a male human. 

** Zones and Quests ** 

- Bazaar - We have increased the limit on the number of traders in the 
bazaar. We fixed an issue that would cause the "Begin Trader" button to 
be disabled if a player tried to use it when the maximum number of 
traders was reached. And the "Held" slot option was removed from the 
search, since it is not a valid option. 

- The Coirnav Encounter has been modified to respawn faster when the 
encounter is failed badly (if the attempt fails to reach a certain 
depth in the encounter). 

- The Illusion: Guktan quest had some issues. We have addressed them. 

** New Player Improvements ** 

- After creating a new character, that character is the default 
selection on the character select screen. 

- At character creation, left-clicking on an attribute displays text 
that explains what that attribute is important for. Right-clicking 
allocates the maximum possible points to that attribute. 

- To help reduce clutter for the new player, the Story window no longer 
pops up when a player first logs in. 

- When a context Tip window pops up, if the Tip of the Day is still 
open, the Tip of the Day window will close. Again, this is to help 
reduce the clutter. 

- We've change the name of the "Camp" button in the Actions window to 
"Camp (Exit)" for clarity. 

- The Inventory Tip window now explains how to read books and notes, 
how to give/trade items with NPC's, and how to scribe spells. 

- We've added a text message on the screen to inform players when they 
are loading a zone, and what zone they are about to enter. 

- Added numeric background to buttons in the Hot Button window to make 
it easier to tell which button corresponds to which number key. 

- The Mousewheel zoom is now enabled by default. 

- New installations of EverQuest will default to 1024x768 resolution. 

** Misc ** 

- Fixed a bug that caused some equipment to be invisible on characters 
created recently (since our update on August 6th). 

- Luclin elemental models will now display if selected, regardless of 
other settings for Luclin models. You can turn these models on with no 
other Luclin models active, and you will see the Luclin elemental. 

- Hitting cancel on a trade window or using the /consent or /deny 
commands will now only send you one message, not two.

------------------------------

- Two Bastion of Thunder keys and one key in the Plane of Air that were 
supposed to open up a location for your entire group were only taking 
the key holder. We have fixed that problem. Also, the Enchanted Ring of 
Torden will now attach to your key ring the next time you use it. 

- The "base" population in the Tower of Solusek Ro now has the ability 
to summon. Please be aware of this the next time you enter the tower of 
the god of flame. 

- We have corrected a pathing issue in South Karana that was causing 
the NPCs to all travel to the same point. 

- Cloth caps will no longer drop off NPCs in Siren's Grotto. 

- We have reduced the number of characters in a raid required to access 
the Plane of Time from 40 to 18. 

- The Burrower has been modified back to its original difficulty. 

- A tether has been added to Fennin Ro.

*** Game Updates ***

** Items **

- Warrior and Magician epic changes – A new version of these two epic 
items is available to accommodate the new item augmentations. Both of 
these epics are basically summoned items, and therefore they would lose 
any augmentations when used or unsummoned. Players wishing to change 
these items into "permanent" versions in order to augment them should 
do the following:

Warrior Epic - Talk to Gartrog Smitehammer in East Freeport. He will 
replace your Red Scabbard and Jagged Blade of War with augmentable 
versions of the Jagged Blade of War, the Blade of Strategy, and the 
Blade of Tactics. You will not receive the Red Scabbard back, as it 
will no longer be useful to you.

Magician Epic - Talk to Ilisiv Gantrau in the Tox Forest. She will take 
a summoned Orb of Mastery and replace it with a permanent augmentable 
orb. The epic pet is still summoned in exactly the same way, with no 
changes to the spell or use.

** Zones and Quests **

- Plane of Mischief - We have updated the factions for a few NPCs for 
this zone on Stormhammer only. All of the NPCs there are meant to be 
aggressive. Some of them were on the wrong faction, and were not 
aggressive. They are now.

- The Deep - There were some NPCs in this zone that could see invisible 
but were bugged to be non-aggressive. They will again be aggressive, so 
be more cautious when using invisibility in The Deep.

- Plane of Valor - The Aerin'Dar projection was despawning after only a 
few minutes. It will now remain as long as other projections.

- City of Mist - Black Reavers are immune to magic once again.

- Oxidized Steel Plate will now drop. This should allow the completion 
of the Rallican’s Bracer quest

- The Ghost of Kindle has returned.

- Manastone is no longer usable in The Hole.

- The trader limit increase mentioned in the last update should be 
working properly now.

** Spells **

- We have reduced the cost of the Summon Wooden, Stone and Iron 
Bracelet spells. 

- We have added new Skeleton models for pets, illusions, and 
transformation spells.

- We have changed the underlying way that pet focus items work to allow 
for future upgrades and items. All existing foci should work as they 
always have. If you notice anything unusual when using a pet focus, 
please /bug report the issue.

** Interface **

- Context Tips - We have added a question mark symbol to windows that 
have help information available. Just click on the question mark in the 
upper right of the window to see the tips.

** Miscellaneous **

- Fixed a bug that was causing NPCs to appear to have a larger melee 
range than they should have in some cases.

- Sullon Zek - There was a bug that allowed players to create 
characters on opposing alliances. That is no longer possible. If you 
see this message: 

"You currently have characters created on opposing deity alliances. You 
can only have characters that are on the same alliance. Please correct 
this by deleting the character that was recently created and has an 
opposing alliance with the first character you created." 

You will not be able to log in until you delete any characters that are 
not on the same alliance.

** Known Issues **
_
This is the list of cosmetic issues that we're aware aren't perfect, 
but determined as acceptable to launch with, as_none should affect 
peoples' ability to enjoy the game._ 
_
Rather than attempt last-minute changes that often break more than they 
fix, these will be addressed in an update after Lost Dungeons' launch.
_
- Paladins and Shadowknights:_ The new INSPECT and OPEN ability buttons 
will *appear* disabled for the duration of your Harm Touch or Lay Hands 
timers when you use those abilities._ You may still use INSPECT and 
OPEN, however._ It just won't look like you can.
_
- When receiving an adventure from one of the Wayfarers' Camps, for 
now, the Adventure Window does not automatically close when you walk 
away from the Adventure Recruiter as it should._ 
_
- Pet Users:_ If you tell your pet to attack an interactive object 
(chest, vase, coffin, etc) inside of a dungeon, your pet will tell you 
that it is attacking, but it will not actually attack._ This is a 
problem with the message, not the behavior. _The pet should be telling 
you that it cannot attack such a thing.

** Use Augmentations Wisely **

If you have an item with more than one slot available and you intend to 
apply an Augmentation Item that can fit into any slot (i.e. Type 1), be 
sure to apply it last.

For example, you have an item with three slots available and you have 
filled Slot 1 with an Augmentation Item. In your bag you have an 
Augmentation Item that can fit into any slot on the item (i.e. Type 1) 
and one that fits into Slot 2. If you use the Type 1 Augmentation Item 
first, it will fill the first open slot on your item, which would be 
Slot 2 in this case. This means you will not be able to use the Slot 2-
specific Augmentation Item you had available. 

So, remember, the rule is that if you have an Augmentation Item that 
can be used it any slot, be sure to apply it last!

.....................................................................

October 9, 2003
------------------------------

* Zones and NPCs **

- Two new raid zones have been added to the Lost Dungeons on the 
Legends server. These are Guk-themed raids, one for Elemental Plane and 
one for Time Plane capable raiders.

- The revamped Plane of Mischief is now available on all Live servers.

- There were some situations where the warders in Vex Thal could be up, 
but the bosses needed to kill them would not be available. That 
shouldn't happen anymore.

- Shrunk the giant wolves that appeared in the lands. 

- The Coirnav encounter has been changed. Be much more careful if you 
have been relying on stuns to deal with this encounter.

- Corrected an issue with the Filth Gorgers that was causing them to 
remain around with they were supposed to despawn.

- Soldiers of Madness in Grieg's End will no longer be so unbelievably 
numerous.

- Zoning into the Plane of Fire will no longer cause characters to 
occasionally take 20k points of damage.

- The Froglok Hunter and Forager will no longer be killed by the 
inhabitants of Trakanon's Teeth, so they should be easier to find.

- When Mithaniel Marr is killed, his planar projection now spawns in 
the middle of his room rather than at the point of death. This fixes a 
problem that could cause the projection to appear out of reach.

- The Qeynos investigator is now taking "follow me" orders again.

** Adventures **

- Every character that successfully completes an adventure will now get 
at least one point as a reward. This is also true for the 
"consolation" rewards.

- Completing Hard adventures will yield more points.

- Several trap spells on interactive objects have had their severity 
reduced.

- Added some new type 7 and type 8 augmentations to various adventure 
merchants.

- It will be clearer now which raids are "hard" and which are "normal". 
Hard raids are intended for Time capable guilds. They are very hard.

- All raid recruiters now properly check to be sure that you have 
completed two adventures in their respective themes before they will 
give out the raid.

- Fixed an issue in a Mistmoore's Catacomb raid that was preventing 
players from accessing an interactive object they had earned for 
killing Sfisithik.

- Removed the ability to see through Shroud of Stealth from some of the 
NPCs that appear in LDoN Raids.

- There was a misconception about the behavior of goblins in some 
Rujarkian Hills adventures. Goblins that are fleeing because they are 
unwilling to die or are seeking help will make it clear that they are 
doing so. We also corrected an issue that could cause these goblins to 
"ping pong" in some cases.

- All of the "flavor" NPCs in dungeons (usually those that are lying 
down, nearly dead) will display full health to make it impossible to 
tell what kind of NPC they are (friend or foe) simply by looking at 
their health level.

- Hostages will no longer be attacked by their captors.

- We thinned out the population in the Grand Library and a few other 
Miragul's Menagerie themed zones to bring the challenge in line.

- Rats in Mistmoore's Catacombs are now animals, shadows are now 
summoned.

** Items and Objects **

- Corrected a bug that allowed players to buy multiple lore 
augmentations if they were in a bag (which also caused issues when 
trying to loot corpses with those items). If you had multiple lore 
items, the extra items will be removed. A refund for the points spent 
on those items will be made when they are deleted.

- Broken Chunk of Coal, Cracked Ruby, and Charred Pebble are no longer 
valid augmentations. If you had these augmentations bonded to an item, 
you will find them on your cursor. You can take those items to Dible 
Hedledrap in South Ro and he will restore your adventure points.

- Perfect Garnet of Constitution, Pristine Garnet of Constitution, 
Perfect Sapphire of Insight, and Pristine Sapphire of Insight can be 
turned in to Dible Heldedrap in South Ro. He will replace them with 
type 8 versions of the same items.

- Changed pre-LDoN items to have a single slot of type 7 instead of 1. 
Some LDoN items which had a slot type 1 were also changed to type 7.

- Fixed a bug with the Adventurer's Stone that would sometimes cause it 
to not display its bonuses.

- Interactive objects will now only appear on LDoN raids when the main 
boss has been killed. This change was done to prevent an exploit, and 
is a temporary change.

- We have improved the types of rewards that can be found in 
interactive objects to improve the reward given for the risk taken by 
opening them.

- Fixed a bug that prevented augments with no deity restrictions from 
combining with deity-restricted items.

- Added a message that should make it clearer when a character is 
unable to loot an interactive object because they are on an NPC's hate 
list.

- Hand-to-hand weapons are now part of the one-handed restriction on 
augmentations. So augmentations that say they can be used with one-
handed items will also work with hand-to-hand items.

- Geomancer's Crown of Reformation now fits in the head slot and the 
effect is worn instead of right clicked.

- Gravestone of Dire Melodies and the Limestone Shard of Battle Cries 
will now properly modify instrument skills.

- All of Royal Attendant Armor will now show up as plate armor.

- Rogue pets focused with Summoner's Boon should no longer lose the 
ability to backstab.

- Shard of Shrunken Bone was changed from Shield of Pain III to Shield 
of Pain II.

- Changed many of the new Lost Dungeons "shields" to make them useable 
as shields (they can be used to bash now).

- Removed augmentation slots from the following items: Primal Velium 
Knight's Sword, Divine Hammer of Consternation, Breezeboot's Frigid 
Gnasher, Primal Velium Fist Wraps, Primal Velium Battlehammer, Primal 
Velium Spear, Primal Velium Claidhmore, Primal Velium Brawl Stick, 
Primal Velium War Lance, Primal Velium Reinforced Bow, Primal Velium 
Battle Axe, Primal Velium Warsword, Ancient Prismatic Bow, Ancient 
Prismatic Lance, Ancient Prismatic Spear, Ancient Prismatic Claymore, 
Ancient Prismatic Brawl Stick, Ancient Prismatic Battlehammer, Ancient 
Prismatic Warsword, Ancient Prismatic Axe, Ancient Prismatic Fist 
Wraps, Ancient Prismatic Staff, Ancient Prismatic Stiletto, and Ancient 
Prismatic Mace.

- Changed some weapons dropped from rare NPC's in LDoN zones to have 
slot type 4 instead of 1.

- Changed Pristine Limestone of Hatred to Vengeance IV.

- The hp/mana augmentations that dropped in adventures as slot 1 items 
will no longer drop. They have been replaced with similar items that 
fit into slot 7.

- Made changes to various stats and effects on Plane of Time items.

- Changed the level required to use the right-click effect on Wild Lord 
Armor to 45, to match all other Kunark armor.

- Corrected a bug with mounts that would sometimes leave the horse buff 
up without the actual mount. Also corrected a problem that could cause 
a player to be unable to summon a mount.

- Fixed the haste on Spiritbound Mystic's Torch 

- Altered the damage and delay on the Delightful Orb of Forgotten Magic 
to be more appropriate for where it drops


** For the New Player **

- Find Feature added. This will create a mystical indication of the 
path to take to find certain people. This feature works in the Bazaar 
and in newbie zones and cities. In the Bazaar you just click on the 
merchant you seek in the Bazaar window and click the Find Trader 
button. For all other uses, just hit CTRL+F to open the window, select 
someone on the list and click the Find button. This will locate any 
Bazaar trader or any NPC with an alternate name, such as (Spell 
Vendor). The exception is that it will not locate NPCs in the 
Wayfarer's Camps.

- The auto-attack key now defaults to Q (not A). 

- New characters start with their weapons and armor equipped.

- New characters start with their spells scribed and memorized.

- When a caster reaches the level required for one of the first two 
rings of new spells, they will get a message informing them that new 
spells are available. 

- New characters will begin with a stack of bandages. These bandages 
cannot be sold or traded.

- When a character trains in a hotbutton-able skill that he did not 
previously have skill in, a hotbutton for that skill is created on the 
cursor.

- New characters will have a page of hotbuttons set for them based on 
the skills given to them by their class and race.

** Interface **

- Merchants now separate items with different charges in their list. 
For example, 9 dose and 10 dose potions will show up as separate items 
on the merchant's list. Items with the same amount of charges will be 
stacked. NOTE: This will remove the ability to "recharge" items by 
selling them to a vendor and buying them back.

- The Bazaar now supports selling different charged items. For example, 
a 10 dose potion with 9 charges can be sold for 90 plat., while a 10 
dose version of the same potion can be sold for 100 plat. NOTE: All 
currently priced charged items will no longer have a price attached and 
will need to be reset by the trader.

- Pet buffs are now visible in the pet window. A small icon will 
display for each buff on the pet (up to 30 - you may need to resize the 
pet window). You can hover your mouse over the icon to see the spell 
name. Alt left-click or right-click and hold for spell info box (which 
only contains name and icon).

- Improved the functionality of the ESC key. Windows close in the 
opposite order that they were opened.

- Swarm pet damage is filtered under "pet damage" rather than "others 
hits".

- When World Containers (ovens, kilns, augmentation sealers and similar 
items) are closed, No Drop items in those containers will be placed in 
the character's inventory. If it will not fit there, it will appear on 
their cursor.

- The "Only show items I can use" option in the Adventure Merchant 
window will be saved when you log out.

- Hotbuttons created using the Abilities and Combat skill lists are no 
longer connected to the buttons in the Actions window. This means that 
you can create a button on the Abilities or Combat section of the 
actions window, drag that button to the hotbutton window, then change 
the button on the Abilities or Combat section, and the hotbutton you 
made will not change. This allows you to create hotbuttons for ALL of 
your character's skills, not just the ones that can fit in the Actions 
window.

- You can now use the (`) key to "Target nearest NPC", in addition to 
F8. 

- Shared bank slots will no longer accept rentable containers with no-
rent items in them.

- A new system for the leaderboard has been implemented to track 
adventures by their difficulty. You can sort by normal/hard/all 
difficulty. Not only will this display the stats for the leaders, but 
you will also be able to see your own successes and failures at the 
bottom, based on the sorting you chose for the leaderboard. So, for 
example, if you filter the leaderboard by Miragul's Wins and choose 
Hard, you will not only see the leaders for Hard adventures in that 
theme, you will see your own statistics for Hard Miragul's adventures. 
NOTE: Because this tracking is new, it will only be able to 
differentiate hard and normal adventures from the time of this update 
onward. Past adventures will be treated as if they were normal 
difficulty. 

- /autojoin is not saved per character, not for all characters.

- The Open and Inspect buttons are no longer "grayed-out" when Lay on 
Hands or Harm Touch are used.

- Merchant inventories will refresh properly after a character 
purchases the last of an item in inventory.

** Spells **

- Casting Grow on an unshrunk shaman pet will no longer shrink the pet.

- Remove Minor Curse cures 2 curse counters instead of 3-4.

- Lich and Pact of Hate now use different colored skeleton models.

- Monster Summoning will summon the correct models, not just earth 
elementals.

- Frostreaver's Blessing will no longer block the bard song Wind of 
Marr. We realize there are still some stacking issues with these 
spells, and we hope to resolve them soon.

** Tradeskills **

- The Blessed Steel Arrowheads recipe will return the file.

- NPC Merchants will now pay less for Steel Hunter Arrows, Steel 
Arrowshafts, and Steel Fletch.

- The Muckskipper Chowder recipe no longer returns a pot on a failure 
or success, since the recipe does not require a pot at all.

- The recipe for the "Lemming Fur Backpack" now requires an 
Embroidering Needle instead of a Sewing Needle.

** Alternate Advancement **

- Jewelcraft Mastery works properly now.

- Frenzied Burnout will no longer last indefinitely on a charmed pet.

created with Elemental capable characters in mind.

adventure from 4 to 3.
- We have increased the consolation prize on level 65 hard adventures 
from 19 to 26 to match the increase in reward points for success 
(raised from 76 to 105 with the last update).
- Verrell Cogswin can help convert red dragon scales into green dragon 
scales.
- Fixed the Undead and Fire event in the Plane of Time. There was a bug 
that could cause some of the minions to fail to spawn.
- Raotin Teawel will always give out the correct robe for completion of 
his quest.
- Thought Destroyer has returned to the Plane of Hate.
- Check with the Town Crier of your home town for news. There is 
information about the recent activities of the Wayfarers that should 
prove interesting.
- We have made some improvements to the Plane of Air avatar rings. We 
have added a random interval to the respawn time of the Plane of Air 
avatar rings, placed apparitions at the avatar spawns so that it is 
possible to tell when the event is available, and the Avatar of Smoke 
will now respawn properly.
- The Mujaki event in Plane of Nightmares was completely rewritten._ It 
should now be a lot more intelligent about where it sends players.
- Increased the number of items found at the end of a successful LDoN 
raid.

** Skills and Alternate Advancement **

- Channeling Focus was not giving bards the proper reduction to the 
chance of missing a note._ It is now fixed and gives messages to 
indicate when it is has helped.
- Corrected a problem that was causing Alternate Advancement buff 
duration increase abilities and duration focus effects to negatively 
affect lull spells. 
- We have fixed a bug that could cause pick pocketed items to not show 
up on your cursor until you zone. This could also sometimes cause the 
client to crash.

track window and hit cancel if you want to cancel your tracking 
quickly.

not have Shadows of Luclin registered. This has been fixed.

will no longer see the mounted player separate from their horse.

lasts 3 ticks instead of being instant.
- Cloak of Luclin, Cloak of the Akheva and Frostreaver's Blessing will 
no longer be overwritten by Call of the Rathe.
- There are still some issues with Frostreaver's blessing being 
overwritten by some spells._ We are aware of the issue and hope to get 
it resolved soon.
- Protection of the Cabbage, Protection of the Glades and Protection of 
the Nine will block Temperance, Aegolism and Virtue.
- Ice Flame of E`ci now has the standard 2.5 second recast time.

Child of Bertoxxulous.

to display the consider color can be removed or edited via XML by 
custom skins.
- We have also added a 3D target indicator._ The ring color indicates 
the con color of the target._ This can be turned off in the Options 
window. A new settings file in the UI folder can be edited by players 
to customize the appearance of the indicator, including different 
animated textures for each con color and other interesting settings.
- Added /fontface command (usage /fontface , e.g. /fontface Courier). 
This will change, on the fly, the fonts used by the interface (and over 
character's heads). Fonts can also be selected in the General Options 
page.
- Added /tell windows. Each time you get a "tell" from a new character, 
a new chat window would open. That window will only display "tells" 
from the particular character, and any message sent from the chat 
window would automatically be sent as a "tell" to that character. You 
can turn this option on and off in the Options window. If you have the 
maximum number of chat windows open when a new tell is received, the 
tell will go to the main chat window
- Temporary pets will no longer send their buffs to the pet window. 
Generally they have none, and they would replace the buffs of any 
standard pet.
- The buff display portion of the pet window will now fade.

parent window.
- The Dump button in raid window now creates the proper, non-blank, 
file.
- We have also added time-stamp to Raid Dump output file.
- Pop-up dialogs no longer close when you press ESC. This will prevent 
the rez dialog from being closed accidentally.
- Lay on Hands will no longer "gray out" the Inspect and Open hot keys 
in the Hotbutton window. This was fixed earlier in the Actions window, 
but now it is fixed in the Hotbutton window as well.

that explains the use of Shift and Control when selecting items.

Headlines! 

Melee Enhancements Part 1 
New Spell Effects Live 
Casino Now Open In Shadowhaven 
HEAR YE! HEAR YE! Check with your Town Crier for new editions of your 
hometown paper! 

*** AA REFUND *** 

- Extended Notes 3 and Sionachie's Cresendo have been refunded (More 
details below). If you had these bard AAs and were close to 30 AA 
points stored, make certain that you spend enough points to have 30 or 
less unspent AA points before you zone. All AA points over 30 are 
removed when you zone. 

- Improved Reclaim Energy has been refunded to magicians due to changes 
with the amount of energy received when cannibalizing their pets. If 
you have this Magician AA and were close to 30 AA points stored, make 
certain that you spend enough points to have 30 or less unspent AA 
points before you zone. All AA points over 30 are removed when you 
zone. 

** Melee enhancements ** 

We have been building an enhancement to the melee system, and the first 
part of it is now Live. 

The yellow bar now represents endurance rather than stamina. 

All Disciplines now require an expenditure of endurance to use. They 
still have a re-use timer, and they can't be used more often than the 
timer allows. 

Disciplines have now been divided into a few different timers. 

We have also added a few of the new melee skills to the game. These are 
the skills that do not use the new "opening" system, but can be used 
without an opening present. The "reactionary" skills and the opening 
system will remain on Test for further tuning. 

Warriors have been given a mitigation boost. This affects all warriors 
at all levels. 

Monks have been given the ability to dodge blows from attackers behind 
them. This affects all monks with the Dodge ability. 

All existing disciplines can be purchased as tomes in either East 
Commons or the Plane of Knowledge. To learn a discipline, the Tome must 
be turned into your guildmaster. 

Several new disciplines have been added for warriors, monks and rogues 
who are above level 60. 

** Play King's Court in Shadowhaven! ** 

Shandeling's Roost in Shadowhaven now houses a game of chance. To play 
you will need to buy a King's Court Token. You then take this token and 
turn it in to any of the dealers. Based on what your hand turns out to 
be, you will be awarded a prize. The highest hands will return a gold 
ticket as the prize. This Ticket can be turned in to win prizes such as 
a Guise of the Deceiver, Fungus Covered Great Staff, or Holgresh Elder 
Beads. Good luck to all that play! 

** Items ** 

- Purchased augments, that have not been bound to an item yet, can be 
sold back to Dible Hedledrap in South Ro. 

- Caerlyna in the Bazaar will trade your containers for tokens and will 
trade tokens for containers. This will allow player characters to sell 
those tokens in the Bazaar. Folks that buy the tokens can then take 
them to the Caerlyna and trade them in for the appropriate container. 
You can exchange most weight reducing tradeable containers for a token. 

- We've changed the +12 Wis on the Copper Medal of Rapture to +12 Int. 
Really, we have! 

- We have lowered the minimum duration to 5 ticks on Affliction 
Efficiency I-IV and Affliction Haste I-IV foci. 

- Timeless Coral Greatsword will no longer claim to be out of charges 
when it procs. If you own one of these swords, you will need to 
petition a GM and ask them to replace your current Coral Greatsword 
with a new one. 

- Phylactery is no longer useable by all classes, only MAG NEC ENC WIZ 
CLR SHA DRU. 

- The Delightful Orb of Forgotten Magic now only procs for characters 
level 35 and above. 

- The following items that had the Invigor effect now have Serpent 
Sight or Ultravision: Orb of the Crimson Bull, Abram's Axe of the 
Stoic, Tolan's Darkwood Boots, Mrylokar's Greaves, Singing Steel 
Vambraces, Crown of Rile, 5 Dose Potion of Wolves Blood, 5 Dose Potion 
of Fleeting Languor, 10 Dose Potion of Wolves Blood, 10 Dose Potion of 
Fleeting Languor, Potion of Wolves Blood, Potion of Fleeting Languor, 
Spiroc Wingblade, Spirit Caller's Boots, Spirit Weaver's Boots, Frozen 
Efreeti Boots, Ring of the Crimson Bull, Rune Crafter's Boots, Wolf 
Caller's Boots and Camii's Bracer of Vigor. 

- The effects on Abram's Axe of the Stoic and Spiroc Wingblade are now 
Worn to activate, not procs. 

** Spells/Songs ** 

- New spell effects! Just about every spell in the game has been given 
a new spell effect. If you have your spell effects turned off, you may 
want to turn them back on. 

- Fixed the bard AA Channeling Focus. It was allowing 100% recovery 
from missed notes in most instances. We have restored it to the 
5%/10%/15% values as documented in the AA window. 

- Fixed a problem with short-duration pets (Rage of Zomm, cleric 
hammers, wizard flaming swords and such) so that they will no longer 
dissipate before engaging the target NPC. 

- Reclaim Energy will now return 75 percent of the mana used to summon 
the pet, 95 percent if the caster has Improved Reclaim Energy. 

- Lull spells with duration less than 5 should no longer be lasting as 
if they had duration 5. This will reduce the duration of some lull-type 
spells to their proper duration. 

- Fixed a problem that caused Protection of the Nine to block Blessing 
of the Nine. 

- We corrected an issue where the same druid damage over-time spell 
cast on an NPC by two different druids would not stack. 

- Bulwark of Vie was reducing spell damage as well as melee damage. It 
now only reduces melee damage. 

- Eye of Zomm will no longer cause players summoned pets to suicide if 
commanded to kill the eye. 

- Improved the melee damage on pets focused by Ritual Summoning. 

- The magician epic pet can now Enrage when focused by Minion of 
Darkness. 

- Increased the offensive capabilities of most pets when focused by 
Summoner's Boon. 

- We have removed the Stamina effects from many spells. 

- Fixed a bug that would cause issues with pet hit points, and could 
cause them to be unable to move if their hit points got too low. This 
may also address other issues with pets using hit-point boosting items. 

** Alternate Advancement ** 

- Extended Notes 3 and Sionachie's Cresendo have been refunded. If you 
had these bard AAs and were close to 30 AA points stored, make certain 
that you spend enough points to have 30 or less unspent AA points 
before you zone. All AA points over 30 are removed when you zone. You 
may, of course, repurchase these AAs. 

- Extended Notes and Sionachie's Cresendo no longer affects harmful 
area-of-effect spells. 

- Jamfest has been fixed. It will now affect the bard's group, not just 
the bard. 

- The Archetype AA ability Spell Casting Deftness was not reducing the 
casting time for the wizard spell Harvest. It does now. 

** Tradeskills ** 

- Merchants will not pay more for a tradeskill product than the cost of 
the components needed to make it. However, they will still sell those 
products for the same amount. 

** Zones and Quests ** 

- Maelin will now respond as though you have the Quintessence, as long 
as you are flagged for time. It is also now possible to receive any of 
the earlier progression flags, even if you have already earned access 
to the Plane of Time. 

** User Interface ** 

- Tell windows now log the name of the person sending tells in the chat 
log. 

- Tell windows now blink when a tell is received, even when the window 
is not minimized. 

- Fixed a problem that caused users some ATI cards to be unable to see 
the /find path or the targeting ring. 

- We have added a new combat ability windown which allows you to make 
up to eight hot keys for disciplines and other new melee abilities and 
displays any current melee effects. The window can be opened by 
pressing Alt+C. The keys are accessible using either the mouse or Ctrl+
1-8. 

** Miscellaneous ** 

- Added some explanation text to the targetindicator.ini file that help 
explain how to modify the targeting ring.

** Shadowhaven Casino goes on vacation ** 

We're sorry to have to say this, but the new casino has become too 
popular. The huge number of players gambling at the casino is causing 
issues with the servers, and has been responsible for a few zone 
crashes. Unfortunately, this means that we have had to remove the 
casino NPCs until after the New Year arrives. 

* Other Changes * 

- Cancel magic will no longer remove disciplines or melee abilities. 

- Fixed a bug that was causing the party to be unable to see hit point 
updates for the last person to join their group. 

- Healing Will and Focused Will now stack with most other hit point 
regeneration effects. 

- Corrected a bug that was causing AAs to increase the duration of 
combat abilities. 

- We have reorganized the context menu for Disciplines to make it a bit 
more logical.

** Stability Issues ** 

The team here at the EQ Lab has isolated a memory leak which was 
causing server instability after 10 to 12 hours of uptime (which we are 
sure you have noticed) We hope to have this issue resolved during 
tonight's update. We would like to thank you all for your patience and 
understanding during these last few trying days and wish you the best 
of luck this holiday season. 

Thanks for your time and thank you for being a part of Norrath.
