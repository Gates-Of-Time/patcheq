September 15, 2011
------------------------------

Here are the patch notes from this morning's game update (taken from the patcher):

    *** Highlights ***

    - Something is about to happen in Steamfont.  Gnomes are running all over the place, babbling about "the project".
    - The current method of fellowship experience sharing has changed. See the "Fellowships" section below for more details.
    - Larger bags can now be found in some House of Thule raid chests. The drop rates of other items in the chests were not reduced in order to add the bags.
    - The Potion of Adventure will now persist through death.  It continues to be a 30 minute duration potion, so you do need to get back in the action quickly.


    *** Fellowships ***

    - The current method of experience sharing has been changed to a vitality system:
       - Experience splitting for fellowship members that have sharing enabled remains the same. However, rather than going directly into the receiving player's experience, the shared experience goes into two vitality pools, one for regular experience and one for AA experience.
       - When a player with vitality in their pools plays, they gain regular and AA experience at a significantly increased rate for kills.
       - The bonus is up to 5x for regular experience and up to 3x for AA experience.  Normal per-kill caps on experience apply.
       - The vitality pools have caps:  approximately enough for 10 levels of regular experience, and enough to reach your AA cap for AA experience.
       - When a receiving player's vitality becomes capped, their experience sharing is automatically disabled (this is displayed in the fellowship window).  It automatically re-enables if some of that vitality is used.
       - Messages about when you receive, use, and deplete your vitality pools are given in chat.  Eventually these will be augmented and/or replaced with visual vitality indicators on your experience bars.
    - You may now join a fellowship only once every 20 hours.


    *** Items ***

    - Larger bags can now be found in some House of Thule raid chests.  With the inclusion of these new bags, the drop rates of other items in the chests have remained the same or increased slightly.
    - The Potion of Adventure will now persist through death.  It continues to be a 30 minute duration potion, so you do need to get back in the action quickly.
    - Inviting Ornate Marble Fireplace, Ornate Marble Fireplace, and Chimney Smoke can now be placed indoors as well as outdoors.
    - The Verdant Selyrah Whistle is now heirloom.
    - An Ancient Text now has a focus and click effect.
    - The icons of several House of Thule items and the Polymorph Wand: Simple Gnoll have changed to match their appearances.
    - All Polymorph Wands can now be equipped in the ranged slot.
    - Terror Infused Linked Coif and Vambraces now have bard focus effects.
    - Grak's Crude Stein and Clurg's Prized Stein now require a little more throwing skill to reach maximum stats.
    - Personal trophies will not be placeable in guildhalls.  Item descriptions on the trophies have been changed to reflect this.
    - The Ruler Ornamentation will now use the correct icon after transforming a weapon.


    *** Tradeskills ***

    - The difficulty of making Nighttime Nostrum has been increased.


    *** Quests & Events ***

    - Something is about to happen in Steamfont.  Gnomes are running all over the place, babbling about "the project".
    - "The Arms of Brell" and "Brell's Will Be Done" - Corrected a problem with the rewards granted by these tasks.
    - The rogue epic step in Hate Plane can now be started with only one person.
    - "Murdunk's Last Stand" no longer requires three players to trigger the arrival of reinforcements.
    - Fixed a bug in the "Terror in the Dark" raid that prevented adds from spawning.


    *** Spells ***

    - Cleric - Adjusted stacking blockers on Reliance and Hand of Reliance so that they will no longer be overwritten by Druid Skin buffs.
    - Druid - Adjusted stacking blockers on Timbercore Skin and Blessing of the Timbercore so that they will no longer be overwritten by Cleric Aegolism buffs.


    *** Progression Servers ***

    - The Sealed Journal now spawns in Nurga on the Progression Servers.


    *** Miscellaneous ***

    - Added more precision when when calculating certain numbers.  This fixes a number of graphical issues including flickering in newer zones.
    - Modified the /testcopy prompt to warn that items in real estates won't be copied.
    - Fixed an error in the potion belt help window.  The command to remove a potion from the potion belt is not "/potionbelt remove". It is "/potionbelt delete".
    - Fixed a server transfer bug with real estates.
    - Made some NPC enhancements to in-game languages.
    - Modified in-game notes, books, etc. to support languages.


    *** Previously Updated ***

    - Corrected issues encountered with mercenary contracts. Any existing contracts should now work correctly.
    - Recruit-a-Friend: The recruiter and the recruit now receive the expected experience bonuses when both are logged in at the same time.
    - Corrected an error in the reward system that was granting lore items to players even if they already had one, which could cause item loss.
    - Extended the "Only the Blind Will See" event until September 6th.

    - Corrected the appearance of the Sirensbane in Qeynos.

    - Fixed an issue with the Extended Target Window where marking a target slot as My Mercenary's Target was not always displaying the mercenary's target.

    - Mercenary Roster -
    - Players can now buy extra mercenary slots on the Marketplace and keep a roster of mercenaries that they can switch between.  Mercenaries operate the way they used to, except that if you purchase another mercenary, it will become active and replace the mercenary you had active before (if any).  Dismissing a mercenary will cause the first remaining mercenary in your roster to become the active mercenary (though suspended).  Transferring a mercenary will cause the target player's active mercenary to be suspended and the newly transferred one to become active.
    - To switch mercenaries in your roster, open the Mercenary Management UI.
    - Added the new command /mercswitch.  With no arguments, it lists the current roster of mercenaries and displays the one that is currently active.  Adding a parameter allows switching between mercenaries in the roster.

    - Changing the ranks of guild members in the access tab should no longer cause the alphabetical ordering to swap.  Additionally, issues with the access tab when members are removed should no longer occur.
    - Fixed a bug that was causing the guild access list to not update when the hide alts or show offline buttons were enabled or disabled.
    - The options window now displays its options as checkboxes instead of large buttons. Clicking on the boxes or label text will enable or disable the options. When an option is enabled, its text is highlighted.
