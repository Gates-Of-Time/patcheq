*** Call of the Forsaken: Argin-Hiz ***

- Call of the Forsaken: Argin-Hiz has been released! The hot ash winds blowing from portals in Ethernere-Tainted West Karana and the Southern Desert of Ro have dissipated, opening the way to the city of Argin-Hiz. The final relic needed to send Lady Lendiniara home lies within the city walls!
- Finish the final chapter of Call of the Forsaken in the all-new zone, Argin-Hiz!

Tudasali, Emissary of Thurgadin, will need your help to defeat the enemies of his people. Starting July 30th, seek out Tudasali in the Great Divide to offer your assistance. This is a "monster mission" that pits adventurers in classic gear against many old world raid targets under a tight time limit!

-- Most quest mobs have had their aggro and assist distances lowered. Ash giants and corpseseeker ashes now have greatly reduced assist distances.
-- The drop rates of all quest items have been increased to 100 percent.

-- When right clicking the bridle of the mount you are currently riding, you will now be automatically dismounted. This functionality does not apply to the Bridle of the Flying Imperial Sokokar.
-- When right clicking the bridle of a different mount than the one you are currently riding, you will be automatically dismounted, and the new mount will be summoned.
-- Paladins and Shadowknights: When right clicking a non-expendable bridle, your mount will be summoned instantly, matching the functionality of the mounts summoned by your AA abilities.
- Being much higher or lower than the chessboard for the Grandmaster fight in Plane of War is no longer a viable strategy to avoid the chess pieces or out-of-bounds penalties.

    "So where did Firiona say she was going, anyway?" Tivalin asked.

    "She said she couldn't tell us all, or else --," Naissa replied, looking upwards and suddenly clamping her hands over her ears. "What is that sound?"

    "What do you mean?" he asked, cocking his head. "I don't hear a thing."

    "My ears are about to burst!"

    "Calm down. You've always been sensitive to powerful magic; it's probably a new experiment. Let me cast this shield over you. It should--"

    "Sit down, hero. I'm not here for you and I don't have time to chat." The dark elven Mistress of Hate stepped over the pair as she stalked into the chamber where the legendary Combine ruler Tsaph Katta had resided since his poisoning. Behind her, water poured into the city.

*** Hotfix ***

* The Cost of Balance - When entering the instance, you will no longer appear under the world.
* All Rivers Lead to the Sea - Multiple copies of Holmein will no longer spawn when the Unseen, Unheard Helper is spam-hailed.
* In Combine Dredge, Pria the Penitent and her placeholders have been moved down the ramp, away from Amlis the Torturer. This will make it safer for players trying to speak with Amlis. Additionally, NPCs on Pria's encounter will be less observant and not see as far.
* Kedge Counterblow - The rare NPC High Guard Vnayyanye or its placeholder "a restive guard" will no longer spawn early in this Heroic Adventure.
