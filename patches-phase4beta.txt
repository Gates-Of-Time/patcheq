Patch server message:

With March 16 approaching, the EQ team is fixing various bugs and improving the game with fire cars throughout the night. A new "/corpse" command has been introduced to recover your items from corpses. You can use this command with a radius of 50' for your corpse to attract the corpse. However, the /corpse command cannot recover corpses from lava. In addition, we added a friends list and random number commands. Both of EverQuest_Manual.txt described in the file. The bugs that have been fixed are as follows:

    * Minor Illusion magic now works normally. It becomes visible as the object that the person changed his appearance.
    * Various modifications to boat travel.
    * You will need food and drinks to recover From Stamina.

------------------

Fixed some major bugs related to sound and crashes. In addition, changes have been made to the decay system of corpses, which are described below;

The next patch will be introduced immediately. It includes changes to the decay of corpses, and all corpses on the Test server are erased. This makes it much longer for corpses to rot if the player's account is not logged into North. If you don't mind losing a body due to this change, don't log out or let your character head to a place where you're at risk of dying. When you get a new patch, sacrifice your newly created and current characters to test this change.

The fix is as follows;

Level 1 corpses remain for an hour if they are not logged in with that account.

Level 2-5 corpses remain for only 8 hours if they are not logged in with that account.

Level 6 or higher corpses remain for only 7 days if they are not logged in with that account.

The numbers above are related to the corpse and the items that remain, and do not include the item as needed. While the corpse's account is logged in, the decay time is as before.

Other bug fixes:

    * Fixed a bug where the connection would be lost after death and return to the character selection screen.
    * Fixed a crash when switching zones.
    * Fixed a lot of issues related to quests and NPC words.
    * Fixed an issue where removing items from the trade window would not disappear.
    * Fixed an issue where new characters could not get guild tunics for a class.
    * Fixed an issue where creatures jumping over water would swim on the ground.
    * Fixed an issue where characters would fly somewhere if they lost their mind when There was no food or water in Inventory.
