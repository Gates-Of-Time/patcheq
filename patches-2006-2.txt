*** Highlights ***

Welcome to EverQuest: The Serpent's Spine, the 12th expansion for EverQuest!

- New Player Race: The Drakkin have been created from both human and dragon blood to protect the future 
of all dragon kind. Several colors and customizations will be available to make each Drakkin character 
unique, such as elegant scale markings and horns.
- Level Cap Increase: Players can now reach level 75, complete with new spells, abilities, raids and 
quests for greater power. 
- Content for Levels 1 to 75: Play through every level of the game without ever leaving the Serpent 
Spine Mountains. The entrance to Serpent's Spine can be found within Highpass Hold.
- New Starting City: Crescent Reach is a fully functioning city with all that is required to learn and 
thrive in EverQuest, including merchant, quest, combat and tradeskill areas. All classes and races are
welcome within the city.
- Dynamic Features: New zones, NPCs, destructible and interactive objects.
- New AAs 

Spell Ranks: The new spells that you can acquire in The Serpent's Spine have different ranks to them. 
The higher ranks of a spell are generally more powerful and more difficult to obtain than the lower 
ranks. When you scribe a higher rank of a spell that you already know, the lower rank will automatically 
be overwritten by the higher rank and your spell casting gems and hotkeys will be updated to reflect that 
you now have a higher rank of the spell.


*** General Game Improvements ***

*** AA System ***

The AA system has undergone some significant back-end changes. The experience you get toward an AA 
point is now based on the difficulty of the NPC relative to you rather than being based directly on 
the NPCs level. This means that you will gain a similar amount of experience killing even con 
creatures at all levels. The amount of experience required to gain an AA is based off the current 
amount required for a level 70 character to do so, so players at level 70 shouldn't see much of a
difference. Players below level 70 will gain AA experience at a rate faster than they were before since 
they are now gaining it at a similar rate as the level 70. Going forward, this rate will remain static 
so the amount of kills to gain an AA point at level 75 will be the same it is at level 70. Current 
abilities and points spent are not affected by this change.


*** Death ***

We've made a change to the way death works. When you die now you will be "hovering" over your body 
and can choose to stay that way while waiting for a resurrection instead of immediately zoning to 
your bind point. This is being done to help players on slow connections who take a big hit from 
having to zone twice when they die.


*** Character Creation ***

We've changed character creation to make it more graphical, allow characters to be created from a 
single page, and updated it to include features associated with the new Drakkin race. As part of 
this, we've set up some character defaults so starting point allocation, starting city, and starting 
deity all have defaults now, which can be changed if you wish.


*** Con Color Changes ***

We have introduced a new con color, dark blue, which represents a range of blue con NPCs that give a 
bonus to their experience due to being very close to your level, generally within 5 levels. The 
concept of a dark blue con NPC has existed in EQ for a while now, but we've decided to change the 
con system to visually include this range so you can visually see when an NPC falls into this 
"sweet spot". To properly display a different shade of blue, we've had to reorder the cons a little 
bit. From trivial to highest con, the colors are now:

- Gray - This creature is trivial to you and will give you no experience for killing it.
- Green - This creature is not much of a threat, but will still give you some experience.
- Blue - This creature is below your level, but high enough level to give you experience.
- Dark Blue - This creature is below your level, but close enough to provide a solid challenge and gives 
you more experience than normal blue cons.
- White - This creature is the same level as you
- Yellow - This creature is slightly above your level.
- Red - This creature is well above your level.

In addition, yellow con now extends up to 3 levels above the player for high end NPCs to help casters 
determine what can be affected by their spells.


*** Downtime ***

As EverQuest has grown over the years, the amount of downtime imposed upon players has grown as well 
and we'd rather players find challenge in the fights themselves than in the time between them. Toward 
that end, we've created a new system that is simple to use, but powerful and flexible enough to control 
downtime as the game continues to grow.

The basics of the new system are simple. Once you have been out-of-combat for a sufficient amount of 
time, you can sit down (or be on a non-moving horse) and begin to rest. While resting, you enter an 
accelerated regeneration state that will quickly recover your mana, health, and endurance. For most 
single group content, once you are out of combat for 30 seconds you can rest. While dealing with 
multi-group content, that time is 5 minutes. The amount of time you have to be out-of-combat before 
you can rest varies for group content and raid content due to the different needs of the different 
encounter types.

There are a series of icons that will display by your character's name to let you know what your 
character's current state is.

- Crossed Swords - You are currently in combat.
- Hour Glass - You are recovering from combat and cannot rest yet. In addition to the hourglass, 
there is a timer bar beneath the endurance bar that will count down as you get closer to being rested.
- Poison Drop - You are no longer in combat, but cannot rest because of a debuff that is affecting 
you. You must get rid of the debuff before you can rest. Certain debuffs now have a yellow border 
instead of a red one. These debuffs do not affect your ability to rest.
- Void - The void is the default icon and indicates that you are not in-combat and you can rest at 
any time.
- Energy Swirl - The energy swirl indicates that you are currently resting.


*** Group Mentoring ***

Players can now share their group leadership experience with another member of their group.


*** Reward Window ***

Tasks within The Serpent's Spine have a new way of giving out rewards. When there are multiple rewards 
to choose from, you will get to choose which one you like from a selection window. If you don’t choose 
a reward immediately, you can bring up the window later to make the selection but you can only have a 
maximum of 5 outstanding rewards at any time. If you go above that, the oldest reward will be replaced 
and you will be unable to claim that reward.


*** NPCs ***

- Corrected a couple of problems in the NPC call-for-help code. NPCs will now call for help immediately 
when attacked regardless of when they were last aggroed if they are no longer aggro. Also, NPCs will now 
properly aggro on the owner of a pet if the pet is sent to attack the NPC.
- Shrewd halfling bankers have set up shop in the guild lobby.
- Coldwind in Nektulos will now offer a confirmation box to players when they try to remove their Curse 
of the Blood AAs.
- Various issues with the Trial of Lashing in Plane of Justice have been resolved.
- The balances in the Kvxe Pirik event in Tacvi will once again reset to full health between waves. 
- The Alchemy vendors have set up shop in Innothule, Everfrost, West Cabilis, and Shar Vahl.
- A new vendor has appeared in East Cabilis that caries some basic adventuring supplies.
- Tani N`mar and Founy Jestands are now pick-pocketable again.
- The skeletons summoned by the Swarm of Decay ability are casting their spells properly again. 
- Tegea Prendyn has grown tired of her ocean view and now rests near an inn.
- Char and Blaze in the ROTA raid now have their spells functioning correctly again.
- Many healer NPCs in Depths of Darkhollow now require some casting time to get off their big heal.
- The Vengeful skeletons in Everfrost should no longer evade the guards quite so well.


*** Tradeskill ***

- Made the Foldable Reinforced Medicine Bag a bit roomier.
- For clarity, the tradeskill trophies and carry-alls now list the lore group they are part of.
- The yield when making metal bits has increased to 2.
- Modified the recipe for Blessing of Reverence to make the spell line more consistent.
- Lost Dungeons of Norrath and Omens of Wars spells have become tradable. Additionally, Lost 
Dungeons of Norrath spells will have no token sellback value to NPCs.


*** Spells ***

- Stun-caps have been added to the various levels of the Strike of Opportunity spells. 
- The Circle of Power aura effects will now improve all melee and ranged attacks instead of affecting 
only one-hand blunt.
- Wolf form illusions will no longer automatically make you KOS to guards.
- Illusion: Tree now uses a different, global tree model rather than the tree model it used to use, 
which was only available in older zones.
- The damage dealt by high level NPCs that have been charmed has been increased.
- Increased the regeneration of pets while they are out-of-combat to keep pace with the increases 
of out-of-combat regeneration for PCs.
- Translocate spells no longer require a reagent.
- The reuse on the warrior disciplines Bazu Bellow and Mock are no longer linked together. 


*** AAs ***

- Most beneficial AA effects that last for less than 30 seconds will now go to the short 
duration buff window instead of the normal buff window.
- Improved Harm Touch and Leech Touch are now on different timers.
- The Shadowknight AAs Consumption of the Soul and Improved Consumption of the Soul now provide 
a greater increase to Leech Curse.
- Refunded all AAs that increased your chance to channel through damage. Channeling is currently 
set to 100% for all classes due to a long standing issue in how it is calculated, so the abilities 
weren't doing anything. This includes Channeling Focus, Channeling Mastery, and Internal Metronome. 
Item Channeling abilities, such as Concentration, are not affected.
- You will now get a message if you have the Stonewall or Willful Death AA and successfully 
feign death through a spell that hit you.
- Lowered the reuse time on the Monk AA Imitate Death to 18 minutes. Modified Hastened Death 
to reduce the reuse by 2 more minutes per rank of the ability.
- Increased the mitigation of the higher ranks of the bard AA Shield of Notes.
- By popular demand, removed Spell Casting Subtlety from the Bard AA lineup. Any points spent 
in that ability will be refunded.

the item.
- Shield of the Immaculate, Amulet of Necropotence, and Holgresh Elder Beads are now flagged all/all.
- Upgraded Stats on Class Specific Items in Demiplane of Blood.


*** Disciplines ***

- You may now learn combat abilities by right-clicking upon the Tomes instead of delivering 
them to your guild master.


*** Miscellaneous ***

- Race based experience penalties have been removed.
- You can you enable texture streaming from the advanced graphics options window. This should 
reduce the total memory used by the client during any given play session.

*** Tradeskills ***

to make. The unfired artisan charm and the firing of the charms is still a difficult process.

are higher level within the con range will now give more AA experience than NPCs that are 
lower level, but con the same.

we will be integrating a new SOE Customer Service interface into EverQuest which will allow us 
to provide you with a Unified Front of customer support where all forms of service will have the 
same general look and feel in a centralized location. You'll also be able to view support and 
service requests in an archived history regardless of how you contacted us or what game you 
contacted us about! For more information on this change please read the announcement in "The 
Town Crier" on the EverQuest forums at http://eqforums.station.sony.com. 


*** Items ***

- Warweaver has been corrected to be a Paladin / Shadowknight only weapon. Players who looted 
the item before the patch have had the item exchanged for a different weapon: Warsorrow. 
- The damage ratios of several high-end TSS weapons have been retuned.
- The Cartographer's Loadstone has been modified so that stat increases are better spread over 
the quest's progression. The final stats are now achieved at the final step of the quest instead 
of the preceding step.


*** Tradeskills *** 

- The recipe names for some of the poisons that use sketches have been made clearer.
- Some poison-making components have had their stack sizes adjusted.
- Fixed a misspelling in the title of Brodder's Lost Diaries.

*** Quests ***

- Many of the Ashengate faction quests should take less time to complete.
- Fixed the combine for the Flowers for Veldyn task.
- Shryyn's Quest "A Fair Trade" is now repeatable. Since this is now repeatable the experience 
given upon completion has been reduced. Additionally the quest item is now lore.


*** Raids ***

- Made some fixes to the King Odeen raid in Valdeholm. He will take a little longer to escape and 
will give warnings if you have almost given him enough time to escape. When he does escape the 
mission will fail outright. Also corrected some errors with the Commander Clanghor (his assistants 
won't run off without him) and with the High Keepers. You will now have to defeat them before 
moving on to the next part of the event and their ability to heal has been removed.


*** NPCs***

- The inhabitants of Frostcrypt will be more likely to see invisible individuals than they did previously.
- Reduced the level of Expin in Greater Faydark so he can be successfully pick pocketed again.
- Mesa Snakes have a bit less poison than they used to have, though the effectiveness of the poison 
is the same.

within the con range will now give more AA experience than NPCs that are lower level, but con the same.

Spooky spirits and strange mishaps seem to be descending upon Norrath. In addition to familiar 
Halloween haunts, keep your eyes peeled for Haunted Jack and Spooky Sally with their fiendish 
holiday treats in your local hometown. There have also been rumors of a strange zombie uprising, 
an increased bout of lycanthropy, and other creepy encounters rising up within Kithicor Forest. 
Take care and watch your step! Folks in need of assistance have been taking refuge within the Plane 
of Knowledge and Crescent Reach.

The festivities kick off tonight at midnight PST and run through the weekend. Happy Halloween!

Coal.

Stones, Lava Ooze Glands, or the Vial of Burning Liquid until you have collected them all.


*** Tasks ***

- Changed an error in the text of Dorina's Quest in the Mesa.
- Corrected an issue with the following Grandmaster Cultural Symbol quests: "Thundercrest Expedition", 
"The Latest in Clockworks!", and "A Bit of Spider, a Bit of Drake". If you are a Dwarf, High Elf, or 
Gnome, have the quest from before this update but haven't completed it, and the task has less than 6 
steps including hidden ones marked with a "???", there are some special steps you can take to update 
your quest to include these changes while keeping your current progress. NOTE: These steps are not 
required and your task can be completed without going through this, but your task may not display updates 
properly. 
1)Go to the Artisan in your home town that gave out the task. Be sure that you have a few minutes and 
do not zone or log out until you have completed all steps.
2) Say "Broken" to the Artisan and it will start a new dialog tree.
3) Read everything carefully and respond appropriately. There will be text in brackets. Be sure to say 
exactly what is in the brackets. You will be asked to remove tasks at certain steps. Be very certain 
you have the correct task highlighted before you hit the remove button. Take your time and follow the 
directions carefully.
4) Following these steps properly will give you the updated the task and preserve the progress you have 
made on the old version.


*** Tradeskills ***

- Some of the grandmaster cultural symbol tasks have been made easier by being less specific about the 
NPCs that are needed for the kill step. For example, if the kill step was "kill 120 Isle Drakes" it will 
now be "Kill 120 Isle Creatures". Additionally, the kill steps will only be able to be completed in the 
base zone, or instance of the base zone that is mentioned in the task text. The loot step will still 
only be on the specific creatures, and only in instances.
- Metal Bits now stack more efficiently.

- Playing as a shroud that is significantly below your regular level now gives reduced experience 
while in a group environment just like it does while solo.
- Instruments are now considered one-handed items regardless of which hand the instrument is 
in so you can wield an instrument and another item at the same time. You cannot wield two instruments 
at the same time.
- Healing a pet now generates much less agro than before. Beware though, healing pets will still be 
noticed by NPCs and they will still be unhappy with the healer if the pet dies.
