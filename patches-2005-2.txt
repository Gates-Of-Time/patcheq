EverQuest - Live Update - 08/11/05 

*** Headlines *** 

Gukta is no more. The Trolls have retaken their ancestral home and torn down the remembrances 
of the Frogloks. The Guktans, suffering more than just defeat, have retreated into the 
Rathe Mountains. They have built a tent city to accommodate their needs, but there is 
something obviously wrong. Many of their friends and family were touched by the curse 
laid upon the battlefield by the Warlord Ykesha. These poor souls have been corrupted. 
They have been torn from the breast of Mithaniel Marr and grasped by the clutching claws 
of Innoruuk and turned to evil. Yet they are cousins and brothers to the remaining Guktans 
and so they live together, trying to make the best of their fate. 


*** Items *** 

- Ancient Mist Root Stone, Refracted Dusk Amethyst, Ancient Life Root Stone, and Refracted 
Dawn Amethyst are now usable in the hands and wrist slots.

*** Missions ***

mission "Diseased Pumas". This change was to fix a discrepancy between the number of 
items required for task completion compared to the number of kills and items looted that 
the task said you needed.

Eyes on Nektulos - From the saddle of her unholy steed, Lanys T`Vyl, the child 
of Innoruuk, surveyed the trolls' as they marched with all of their belongings 
and wares from Neriak, the dark elf city they called home for a time, to the 
city of Grobb in the Innothule Swamp. The frogloks had finally lost their foothold 
in Grobb and now the smelling, foul race of trolls had their home back. 

She kicked her steed into motion and made haste through Nektulos Forest making a 
cursory survey of the lands and then turned to Neriak where dark fates would soon

Welcome to EverQuest: Depths of Darkhollow! 

As Lanys T'Vyl and Firiona Vie crossed blades in Nektulos Forest, a failed curse 
exploded that shook the lands from sky to stone. When all settled, for a time there 
was no sound. Firiona, Lanys, their armies, all the beasts and creatures had vanished 
from the grove where the curse was bound. But down at the end of the forest river 
where it ducked under loose stone, a way into darkness was revealed -- passage into 
a subterranean world called Darkhollow. 

For more details on what befell those in Nektulos Forest, see today's story entry! 


~** Depths of Darkhollow Highlights **~ 

** Monster Missions ** 

- Have you ever wondered what it must be like to be a monster in Norrath? Now you 
can find out! Through Monster Missions, you are able to enter the bodies of a 
variety of characters and be transported into a different time to re-enact the 
past or play a critical role in Norrath's future. These missions are found in 
Darkhollow and other areas around Norrath, like Nektulos Forest and Butcherblock. 
- While you play in a monster mission, your main character earns experience and, 
quite often, rewards! The rewards you gain from monster missions appear in the 
inventory of your main character when the mission is successfully completed. 


** Spirit Shrouds ** 

- Shroudkeepers have learned to channel spirits in the ethereal world. They are found 
in the Plane of Knowledge and can offer you the form of one of Norrath's creatures 
through a Spirit Shroud! The Shroudkeepers can transform you into creatures in various 
categories, like Undead or Animal. The Spirit Shroud itself changes your form and 
gives you a specific set of abilities, like a fighter or healer, depending on the 
shroud you picked. Once you've selected a shroud type, you can choose to play a 
creature of that type of any available level less than or equal to your own level. 
- While you adventure with a Spirit Shroud, you will gain experience for your main 
character. When you remove your shroud, the items you collected will appear in your 
Shroud Storage which is accessed at a banker. Also, as you use the Spirit Shrouds in 
a particular category you will gain enough knowledge and experience to unlock new forms. 


** Evolving Items ** 

- As you adventure and advance in Norrath, you may find new items that will learn 
and grow right along with you! These Evolving Items change over time the more you 
use them, including their names and statistics. These weapons and worn items are 
marked as Evolving and will show their status in a percentage upon inspecting them.
You can watch that status grow as you kill monsters! When it reaches 100 percent, 
presto, you will have the next level of your item! 


** Intelligent Items ** 

- Imagine what some of your gear might say to you if it could talk. Now some will! 
Intelligent items, much like evolving items, are now found in Norrath and will show 
their status when inspected. As they grow, they change their statistics and even what 
they say. They can talk to you and, sometimes, people around you (you can customize 
these chat options). These items usually have something to say about your actions, 
so keep your eyes open! 


** Tradeskills ** 

- The gnomes of Corathus have amassed a collection of new tradeskill items. You will 
find some vendors with books detailing javelins, food and drink, and new ways of doing 
spell research. Merchants who frequently traffic in high quality ore have been taking 
a keen interest in the new ores and minerals of Darkhollow and often have surplus 
available for purchase by others. 
- The new spell research is a totally different system that covers a large majority 
of spells that were found in Planes of Power, and Gates of Discord, though not all 
of them. The new system may seem more complex than the way you are used to doing spells, 
but is much more systematic than the previous system and will be more consistent. 
- Additionally, there are new highly powerful augments for cultural armor? One of the 
Gnomeworks is a bit damaged and if you have something of interest to him, he may be 
willing to help you with a way to make them. Good luck! 


** AAs ** 

- New AAs are now available to players who own Depths of Darkhollow. 


** Spells ** 

- New Spells are now available to players who own Depths of Darkhollow 


~** EverQuest: Escape to Norrath **~

school, or in-laws plain taken the fun out of their days? If this is the case, 
invite your friends to Escape To Norrath to join you in your adventures throughout

~** Other Update News **~ 

** [EQ] Menu Button ** 

- We have added new functionality to the UI. The window selector is no longer available. 
The functionality is now neatly folded and tucked away in the [EQ] Button. Clicking on 
the [EQ] button will extend a menu that includes the most vital and commonly used 
screens in the game. 


** AAs ** 

- Based on player feedback, we?ve changed the way that Turn Undead and Turn Summoned 
work to make it more useful in normal grouping situations. Both abilities have been 
refunded and new versions are available for purchase. The new versions are 5-minute 
reuse, single-target DoTs that have a chance to do a massive amount of damage to the 
targeted creature when they land, likely destroying it in one hit. The core abilities 
are still level 59 class abilities and upgrades are available at level 65 for Planes 
of Power and level 70 with Depths of Darkhollow. 
- Due to the changes to Turn Summoned and Turn Undead, the AAs that decreased their 
reuse times are no longer applicable so they have been removed and refunded. 
- The duration of Divine Avatar has been increased to 3 minutes and the reuse time 
has been lowered to 36 minutes. 
- The reuse time on Rabid Bear has been reduced to 36 minutes. As part of this change, 
the ability will no longer have its duration increased by focus effects. Hastened 
Rabidity has been changed to lower the reuse on Rabid Bear by 4 minutes per rank. 
- Reduced the casting time on Wake the Dead and Army of the Dead. 
- Rhythmic Reflexes and Superior Rhythmic Reflexes had their double attack values 
switched. This has now been corrected. 


** Tradeskills ** 

- Added some recipes to create Soy Sauce for the Chef Chowderly quest. 
- Modified the stats on numerous pieces of the Cultural Tradeskill armor. 
- The Salvage bug when using world containers has been fixed. 
- Tradeskill recipes that result in a LORE item that you already have and is not 
a tool will now block with a message. 


** NPCs ** 

- High quality ore vendors will no longer fall for your tricks. 
- Volkara will now appear as a spider rather than a 20-foot human male. 
- NPC's in Halls of Honor should no longer gate home when there are too many pets in 
the nearby vicinity. 
- Made a minor modification to the Mata Muram script to fix a loophole in the gaze 
list logic.

- Volkara will no longer grow in power if she is outside of her lair. Her encounter 
will now be the same no matter where she is fought. 
- Kessdona's manashard guardian adds should now activate correctly and in sequence. 
- Changed the required count for the kill and loot elements on the Dragons of Norrath 
mission ?Diseased Pumas?. This change was to fix a discrepancy between the number 
of items required for task completion compared to the number of kills and items 
looted that the task said you needed. 


** Quests ** 

- The Ancient Sebilite Protector in Sebilis should no longer double-spawn his helper-golems, 
and the event should despawn / reset normally again. 


** Items ** 

- All arrows and throwing items now are max stack size of 100. 
- All spell scrolls should now be stackable. Please note that if you try to scribe 
more than one spell scroll at one time by using a stack of spell scrolls, that you 
will receive an error message. You must use only one spell scroll to scribe a spell. 


** Spells ** 

- Modified Intensity of the Resolute so it won?t be overwritten by other, lesser 
abilities. 


** Tutorial ** 

- In case you missed it above, the tutorial has changed. Not only have we added new 
content and made it more user friendly and streamlined, we actually made it a standalone 
experience you can give to your friends to learn how to play EverQuest. Please refer to 
the EverQuest: Escape To Norrath website for more details: http://escapetonorrath.station.sony.com/index.vm 


** UI ** 

- There are now 4 Hotbutton windows that can be visible at the same time. Use the Options 
window to set keys for showing/hiding the windows, as well as setting keys for the 
individual Hotbuttons in them. Note to skinners, your old skin should work for the 
single Hotbutton window contained in it, but you'll need to update to see more than 1. 
- Item Links have changed format. 
- Bazaar search results, when the item is viewed, should now show the correct number of 
charges for charged items. 
- The Task Select window now autoselects the first task in the list. 
- The Guild Management Window level display bug should be fixed.

can be regained through an experience rez or until the experience rez timer has expired.

Audio triggers are sound effects that are played when certain patterns appear in the 
chat window. You can make audio triggers to play any sound you want when something 
you want to be sure not to miss appears in the chat window. This might be /tells from 
specific friends, certain buffs fading, or any other event you can think of that has a 
text message associated with it. The window used to configure your Audio Triggers can 
be accessed via the EQ button -> Actions -> Audio Triggers. 

There are a couple key ideas that make up Audio Triggers. 

Audio Triggers are a collection of text patterns associated with a sound effect. 
The window shows a list of all active audio triggers. They are sorted by priority 
so that the first pattern that matches text in the chat window will be the one and 
only sound that is played. This allows patterns to be made, for example, "tells you" 
and "yourbuddy tells you" that may have different sound effects. The "Move Up" and 
"Move Down" commands allow you to control which patterns will be tested first. 

Creating a new trigger is a simple matter of typing text in the "Pattern" field, 
selecting a sound in the "Sound" control, and pressing "Create". 

The other controls include: 

* Apply - changes the sound selected for the current pattern. Note that changing a 
pattern requires a new pattern to be made. 
* Play - plays the currently selected sound again. 
* Delete - delete the currently selected trigger. 

Trigger Sets 

Trigger Sets are similar to choosing a UI skin. Each trigger set represents a set of 
patterns associated with sounds that is stored on a per-character basis. You can 
switch trigger sets by selecting the drop-down control and selecting among the listed 
options. Unless you have installed custom Audio Trigger sets, you will only see the 
"default" entry. 

Each trigger set is stored as a folder in the AudioTrigger folder in your EverQuest 
directory which can contain .wav files unique to that trigger set. The goal here is 
to provide a way for the player community to create and share their own Audio Trigger 
sets that people find useful for different classes or play styles, much like they have 
done for custom UI skins. 

An example of a useful trigger set may be a set of patterns 
There are many possibilities. Due to the differences in play styles, there is no 
way to predict what settings people might prefer so the default settings are empty. 
We encourage players to discover and share ways to make this a fun part of their 
gameplay. 

Notes on customizing Audio Triggers: 

* Any .wav files found in the folder .\AudioTriggers\shared will be made available 
to all Audio Trigger sets in the Sound selection control. You will probably want to 
put most of your custom sounds in this folder, unless you are making custom Audio 
Trigger sets. 
* Creating a new Audio Trigger set is similar to making a new UI skin. It's not 
complicated but it's not built into the UI. Create a folder in 
.\AudioTriggers\NewTriggerSetName and put any .wav files specific to this trigger 
set in there, and you will be able to start using the new trigger set the next time 
the program is started. 
* User settings for each Audio Trigger set can be found in 
.\userdata\AT_TriggerSetName_CharacterName_ServerName.ini. You can copy these 
files to other characters as needed. You will probably want to include a sample
of this if you make an Audio Trigger set that you plan to share because this is 
what contains all the details on each specific trigger pattern and sound. 

The above instructions are available in-game via the help button on the audio 
triggers window.

challenging, particularly the hard level missions.
